# Zhong Shan Da Xue Ji Di

Zhong Shan Da Xue Ji Di (simplified Chinese: 中山大学极地; traditional Chinese: 中山大學極地; pinyin: Zhōngshān Dàxué jídì; lit. 'Sun Yat-sen University Polar') is a Chinese icebreaker owned by the Sun Yat-sen University. She was built in 1983 as an icebreaking anchor handling tug supply vessel (AHTS) Ikaluk for BeauDril, the drilling subsidiary of Gulf Canada Resources, to support offshore oil exploration in the Beaufort Sea. In the 1990s, the vessel was acquired by Canadian Marine Drilling (Canmar) and renamed Canmar Ikaluk. In 1998, she was purchased by Smit International and served in the Sakhalin oil fields as Smit Sibu. In 2009, she was acquired by FEMCO Management and in 2012 given back her original name. Ikaluk was sold to China in February 2018 and renamed Beijing Ocean Leader (Chinese: 北京号破冰船). In late 2021, the vessel was acquired by its current owner and given its current name.
