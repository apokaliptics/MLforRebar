# Mystacodon

Mystacodon is a genus of toothed baleen whale from the Late Eocene Yumaque Member of Paracas Formation (previously called as Yumaque Formation) of the Pisco Basin in southwestern Peru. It is the oldest known baleen whale, and was probably a suction feeder of small prey on the seafloor.
