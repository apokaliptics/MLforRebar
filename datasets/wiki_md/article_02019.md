# List of rolling stock preserved on the North Norfolk Railway

The North Norfolk Railway, a heritage line operating in Norfolk, England, has a large collection of heritage rolling stock, mostly relating to the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) branch lines in Norfolk. The rolling stock preserved on the North Norfolk Railway is used to operate trains on the NNR, also known as the "Poppy Line", which runs between the coastal town of Sheringham and Holt. Some vehicles are also approved to operate over Network Rail, mostly in connection with dining services to Cromer.
There is a variety of preserved steam and diesel locomotives and diesel multiple units, passenger coaches and goods wagons. Some are owned by the railway itself but most are owned by individuals or voluntary groups. The line is also regularly visited by locomotives based elsewhere.
