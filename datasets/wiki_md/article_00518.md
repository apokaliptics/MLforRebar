He won the silver medal in the slalom before a home crowd at the world championships in 2003 at St. Moritz, and was the Olympic bronze medalist in the combined in 2010 in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, held at Whistler. Following his silver medal at age 21, he was the Swiss Winter Sportsman of the year in 2002 / 2003.
