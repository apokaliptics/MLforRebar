# Rai Pannalal Mehta

Mewar Vibhuti (distinguished; विभूति), Pradhan Rai Pannalal Mehta (1843–1919) served four Maharanas, as Prime Minister of Mewar state in former state of Rajputana (now Rajasthan) in India.
Rai Pannalal Mehta carried out the duties of Munshi (Secretary) Mahakma Khas (Executive Council) from 1869 to 1878 AD. De facto he was carrying out the duties of Pradhan (Prime Minister), as most of the time the post of Pradhan was either not filled or their powers were diluted. In 1878, he was formally appointed as Pradhan. In 1894, on the advice of Agent to the Governor General, Col GH Trevor, Pannalal proceeded on long leave and whilst on a pilgrimage, he resigned.
During his tenure as Pradhan, Rai Pannalal Mehta was instrumental in conceiving and promoting various reforms and public interest projects:

The Separation of judiciary from executive and the publication of the first regular Gazette cum Journal.
Land and fiscal reforms and introduction of financial budget.
In 1885, Lord Dufferin, then Viceroy of India, laid foundation for New Walter Zanana Hospital (now Ayurvedic Hospital at Moti Chohatta, Udaipur)
In 1889, Prince Albert Victor, inaugurated the marble statue of his grandmother Empress Victoria in Gulab Bagh.
In 1889, Lord Lansdowne, then Viceroy of India, inaugurated public library (now Sarasvati Sarvajanik Pustakalya) in Gulab Bagh, Udaipur.
In 1889, Duke and Duchess of Connaught, laid foundation of Connaught Dam (now called Fateh Sagar Paal).
In 1889, Marwar-Mewar railway line project (1885–89) completed.
In 1889, amicably resolved century-old border dispute between Marwar and Mewar at Pagliya-ki-Naal (Desuri), directly with Maharaja Jaswant Singh of Jodhpur, Marwar.
In 1891, proposed construction of railways line to connect Udaipur with Chittor, but it was stalled by vested interests.
