# Zappone v. Revenue Commissioners

Zappone & Gilligan v. Revenue Commissioners & Ors [2006] IEHC 404 (also known as the KAL Case) was a High Court case which was one of the first major events in the debate on the recognition of same-sex marriage in Ireland. The plaintiffs Ann Louise Gilligan and Katherine Zappone unsuccessfully sought recognition of their Canadian marriage.
The case helped prompt the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, as well as the Thirty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland which allowed for the Marriage Act 2015, which legalised same-sex marriage in the Republic of Ireland.
