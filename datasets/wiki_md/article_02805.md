# Cambodian Canadians in the Greater Toronto Area

Toronto's Cambodian population consists of 6,430 ethnic Cambodian people. In 1999, 98% of Cambodians in Toronto identified themselves as Khmer people.
Cambodians first arrived to Canada as a result of the 1970s' Cambodian genocide, a four-year period in which nearly 2 million Cambodians were murdered. Their community would originate in Jane and Finch, and as they diversified in profession and status, many relocated into other cities such as Vaughan, Newmarket, and Hamilton.
