# CROCUS

CROCUS is a research reactor at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne, a research institute and university in Lausanne, Switzerland.
The uranium nuclear reactor core is in an aluminium container that measures 130 centimetres (51 in) across with 1.2-centimetre (0.47 in)-thick walls.  The aluminum vessel is filled with demineralized light water to serve as both a neutron moderator and a neutron reflector.
Power output is controlled either by adjusting the water level in the reactor—with a ±0.1-millimetre (0.0039 in) level of control, or with the adjustment of two boron carbide (B4C) control rods—with a ±1-millimetre (0.039 in) level of finesse.  The reactor has six separate safety systems: two cadmium shields and four storage tanks, any of which can shut down the reaction in less than a second.
CROCUS has a license to produce 100 watts (0.13 hp) or a neutron flux of ~2.5 × 109 cm-2s-1 at the core's center.
