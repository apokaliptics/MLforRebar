# Skull-A-Day

Skull-A-Day is an ongoing online art project/blog created by artist Noah Scalin. For its first year the site consisted of daily skull art creations made by Noah as well as weekly submissions by fans of the project. After Noah finished his project, he has continued to post daily images of skulls created by fans to the site.
