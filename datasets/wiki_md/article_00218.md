# Jane Barnes (actress)

Jane Fenmore Barnes (August 17, 1910 – March 20, 1998) was an American film and theatre actress during the 1930s. She originally studied to become a concert pianist before deciding to become an actress instead, spending several years on the theatre circuit along with radio dramas and modeling before becoming a film star for Fox Studios. 
Cast in multiple major and minor film roles from 1934 through 1937, she then returned to theatre work to hone her acting skills before marrying actor Carlyle Moore Jr. in August 1937. When her theatre plans in New York on Broadway did not work out, she became a columnist for multiple papers, moving several times back to Massachusetts and then Hollywood. In her later years, she settled in Victorville, California, and became a part of her local library group to support her love of books.
