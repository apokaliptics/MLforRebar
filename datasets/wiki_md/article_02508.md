# Born to Lie

"Born to Lie" is a song by American supergroup Dreamcar for their self-titled debut studio album (2017). It was produced by Tim Pagnotta and written by the group's four members Tom Dumont, Davey Havok, Tony Kanal, and Adrian Young. The song was released as a promotional single for the album on April 7, 2017, through Columbia Records, and their second song overall. It is an alternative and new wave song with a dance beat. Stylistically, the song was compared and contrasted with Dreamcar's previous single, "Kill for Candy" (2017). Lyrically, "Born to Lie" discusses someone who has been unable to find or maintain a romantic relationship.
Some music critics discussed the roles of individual Dreamcar members in "Born to Lie", particularly Havok. They also compared it to the works of other bands, including Depeche Mode, A Flock of Seagulls, and the Killers. The song was promoted through the release of an animated lyric video via the group's YouTube channel.
