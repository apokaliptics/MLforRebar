# Naturism in the United States

Naturism in the United States is the practice of social nudity as a lifestyle that seeks an alternative to the majority view of American society that considers nakedness and sexuality to be taboo based upon the legacy of Puritan and Victorian attitudes.
Enthusiasm for naturism began in the late 1920s with the establishment of members-only communities where naturists could gather to socialize and enjoy recreation without clothing in an environment that was no more sexual than that experienced while clothed. In later decades some groups began advocating for more general acceptance, and the opening up of public land to clothing-optional recreation. The mainstream American view of nude recreation (more often referred to as nudism than naturism) is that it is "tolerable deviant leisure activity" classified with moderate drinking and gambling. Psychologists Jessica Hamblen and Kim Mueser list "going naked" among over 250 other pleasurable activities in a book about aiding mental wellbeing in the context of disaster aftermath.
