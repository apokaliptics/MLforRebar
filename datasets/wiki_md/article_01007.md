# Zhou Qi (Jin dynasty)

Zhou Qi (258 – c. August 313), courtesy name Xuanpei, was a military general of the Jin dynasty (266–420). The eldest son of the general, Zhou Chu, he was a prominent figure among the Jiangnan gentry clans who led them against the rebels Shi Bing, Chen Min and Qian Hui, which became known as the "Three Pacifications of Jiangnan" (三定江南). His deeds allowed the Prince of Langya and future Emperor Yuan of Jin, Sima Rui to settle in the Jiangnan, but suspicion grew between the two as the prince began favouring the northern emigres families (僑姓士族), who sought refuge due to the upheaval of the Five Barbarians, over the southern indigenous gentry clans (吳姓士族). He plotted to eliminate the northern emigres but failed and soon died in anger.
