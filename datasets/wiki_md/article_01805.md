# Winteringham Haven railway station

Winteringham Haven railway station was a port facility on the south bank of the Humber Estuary, Lincolnshire, England. It was constructed by the North Lindsey Light Railway at the end of a 1⁄2 mile branch line from Winteringham. The railway company provided two chutes to load ships, one for coal the other for slag, a by-product of the iron and steel making process. It was opened on 15 July 1907.
