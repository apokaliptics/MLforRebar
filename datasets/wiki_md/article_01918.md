# September 20, 2007, Osama bin Laden video

Nine days after Osama bin Laden released his latest video, September 11, 2007 Osama bin Laden video, on the sixth anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks on New York and Washington, he released a new tape on September 20, 2007 called "Come to Jihad" with his voice over previously released footage of him. In the tape, bin Laden called on Pakistanis to overthrow President Pervez Musharraf, promising what he called retaliation for the storming of the Red Mosque in the capital, Islamabad, in July.
