# List of invasive species in India

Invasive Alien Species (IAS) represent a grave threat to India's globally significant biodiversity, agricultural productivity, and public health. These are non-native organisms—encompassing plants, animals, and microbes—that, once introduced, establish themselves and proliferate rapidly, causing devastating ecological and economic consequences. A Assessment report, compiled by National Biodiversity Authority for the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change, Government of India, is crucial for framing the national management strategies, identifying species based on their known impacts (such as biodiversity loss, economic loss, and health hazards), and tracking their continued range extension across various Indian ecosystems.
