# List of S-phrases

S-phrases were defined in Annex IV:Safety advice concerning dangerous substances and preparations of the European Union Directive 67/548/EEC - Dangerous Substances Directive. The list was amended and republished in Directive 2001/59/EC. The list was subsequently updated and republished in Directive 2006/102/EC. The entirety of Directive 67/548/EEC, including these S-phrases, were superseded completely on 1 June 2015 by Regulation (EC) No 1272/2008 - Classification, Labelling and Packaging Regulations.
These safety phrases were used internationally and not just in Europe, and there is an ongoing effort towards complete international harmonization. This harmonization would be carried out by the United Nations's Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals, that replaced Directive 67/548/EEC under CLP Regulation. S-Phrases successor in GHS were GHS precautionary statements, which encompasses both s-phrases and R-phrases.
