# Landenberg Junction (Delaware)

Landenberg Junction is a railroad junction in Elsmere, New Castle County, Delaware.
The junction is situated at the southern end of CSX Transportation's Philadelphia Subdivision Wilsmere Yard in the eastern terminus of the Wilmington and Western Railroad, which originally ran to Landenberg, Pennsylvania. Both lines were formerly owned by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&O).
The Wilmington and Western Railroad once ran from Elsmere to Landenberg, Pennsylvania, but the B&O shortened it to Southwood in the 1940s and later to Hockessin in the 1950s. The current Wilmington and Western Railroad operates tourist trains between Greenbank and Hockessin.
