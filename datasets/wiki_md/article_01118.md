# Best F(r)iends

Best F(r)iends is a 2017 American dark comedy thriller film starring Tommy Wiseau and Greg Sestero. Written and produced by Sestero in two parts (Volume One and Volume Two), it marks the reunion of Wiseau and Sestero 15 years after making the cult classic film The Room. The plot follows a homeless drifter in Los Angeles who begins working at a morgue, only to realize his boss is hiding a mysterious past.
The film played at various festivals starting in September 2017, and in 2018 it was distributed theatrically in two volumes through Fathom Events. Best F(r)iends: Volume One received one screening each day on March 30 and April 2, 2018, and Volume Two received the same treatment on June 1 and 4.
The film received generally mixed reviews, though some critics praised its use of Wiseau and believed it could appeal to fans of The Room.
