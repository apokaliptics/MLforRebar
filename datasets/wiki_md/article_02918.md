# Tatankamani

Red Wing II (c. 1755–1829), also known as Tatankamani (French: Le Boeuf qui Marche, lit. 'Walking Buffalo') was a leader of the Mdewakanton Dakota in the upper Mississippi Valley. During the War of 1812, Chief Red Wing II initially supported the British together with other Dakota chiefs, but switched sides to support the Americans in 1814. His village was at Barn Bluff in present-day Red Wing, Minnesota.
