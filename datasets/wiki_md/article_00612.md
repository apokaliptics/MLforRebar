Born in the United Netherlands, Verhaegen traveled to the United States at the age of 21, where he studied at the Jesuit novitiate in Maryland. In 1823, he was sent to Missouri, and eventually became the president of Saint Louis University in 1829, of which the Jesuits had newly assumed responsibility. During his leadership, the college was chartered by the state and was elevated to the status of university.
