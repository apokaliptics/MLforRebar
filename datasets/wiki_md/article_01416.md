# Die Another Day (soundtrack)

Die Another Day is the soundtrack for the 20th James Bond film of the same name, and was released by Warner Bros. Records on November 12, 2002.
Composer David Arnold made use of electronic rhythm elements in his score, and included two of the new themes he created for The World Is Not Enough. The first, originally used as Renard (Robert Carlyle)'s theme for the previous film, is heard during the "Antonov" cue on the recording, and is written for piano. The second new theme, most easily described as James Bond (Pierce Brosnan)'s romance theme, is heard here on the "Going Down Together" track. There is also a second romance theme in Die Another Day which was previously used on The World Is Not Enough soundtrack titled "Christmas in Turkey", and can be heard during the Miss Moneypenny (Samantha Bond)/Bond virtual sequence.
In November 2017, La-La Land Records released a limited expanded edition containing previously unreleased music.
The album received mixed to negative reviews.
