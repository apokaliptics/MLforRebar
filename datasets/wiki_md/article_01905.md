# La-Mulana

La-Mulana (stylized as La•Mulana) is a platform-adventure video game, designed to imitate the look and feel of MSX games. Released on June 27, 2006, in Japan for Microsoft Windows, the game was only available in Japanese, but an English translation patch has been produced by Ian Kelley of AGTP. The game was later remade from the ground up in a 16-bit style for the Wii, and later PC, Mac, Linux and PlayStation Vita.
