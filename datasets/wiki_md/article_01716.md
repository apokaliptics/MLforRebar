# Longview, Alberta

Longview is a village in southern Alberta, Canada. It is located in the Canadian Rockies foothills, on Cowboy Trail, 32 km west of High River and 64 km  south of Calgary. Highwood River flows west of the village.
Longview is known for its long view west toward the first range of the Rocky Mountains, its cattle ranching heritage and its natural resources (principally oil), but more importantly the open spaces, rivers (the Highwood) and some of the finest beef by most standards.
Longview is also known as the home of late Canadian Country Music star Ian Tyson.
