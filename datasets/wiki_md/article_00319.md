# Torchlight (song)

"Torchlight" is a song by Australian singer-songwriter Missy Higgins, written for the Australian film Don't Tell, a true story about a young girl seeking justice against the church. In the ballad, Higgins sings of the issues explored in the film: "Sometimes evil is a quiet town where nobody wants to hear your truth / and nobody wants to believe you."
The track was released on 5 May 2017.
In November, the song won an APRA Screen Music Award for Best Original Song Composed for Screen. This was Higgins' first APRA Screen Music Award. It is also the song played at the end of last episode of season 1 in the Australian television series Janet King.
