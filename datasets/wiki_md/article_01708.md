# Seer Bonnet

Seer Bonnets is a series of sculptures created by the American artist Angela Ellsworth. The series began in 2008 and continues into the present. The base of each piece is a pioneer-style bonnet that Ellsworth then covers in thousands, sometimes tens of thousands, of pearl corsage pins. The pearls sit on the outsides of the bonnets while the insides are crowded with the sharp ends of the pins. Each bonnet has an individual design and size, but they are all standardized in the general construction and materials used. The design includes a large brim, bonnet crown, and long ribbon-like pieces that would have been used to fasten the headpiece. Though these pieces were modeled after traditional sunbonnets, the color pallets differ. The corsage pins Ellsworth used are light and pearly, while historical pioneer women’s sunbonnets would have been made from earthier tones in order to mask wear over time.
