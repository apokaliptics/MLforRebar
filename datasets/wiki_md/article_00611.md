# Limitless (TV series)

Limitless is an American comedy-drama television series that aired on CBS for one season from 2015 to 2016. It is a continuation of the 2011 film of the same name, and takes place four years after the film's events. The series stars Jake McDorman as Brian Finch, who samples a mysterious nootropic drug, which unlocks the full potential of the human brain and gives its user enhanced mental faculties.
Limitless premiered on CBS on September 22, 2015 to mixed reviews from critics. After a single 22-episode season that ended on April 26, 2016, showrunner Craig Sweeny announced that CBS cancelled the series.
