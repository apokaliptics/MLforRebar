# School of Philosophy of São Bento

The School of Philosophy of São Bento (Portuguese: Faculdade de São Bento) was Brazil's first Philosophy school. It is located in Largo São Bento, in the center of São Paulo, next to the Monastery of Saint Benedict, which dates back to 1598.
Founded in 1908, it was incorporated by PUC-SP (Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo) in 1946 and returned to its activities with a new Philosophy degree program in 2002. It was initially attached to the University of Louvain, which sent professors such as Monsignor Carlos Sentroul and Leonardo Van Acker. In 2008, the School of Philosophy of São Bento celebrated its 100th anniversary and launched its Master's course in Philosophy.
