# Rehoboth Beach Pirates

The Rehoboth Beach Pirates were a minor league baseball team based in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. From 1947 to 1949 Rehoboth Beach played exclusively as members of the Class D level Eastern Shore League, winning the 1949 league championship in the league's final season of play. The Rehoboth Beach "Pirates" were a minor league affiliate of the Pittsburgh Pirates in the 1947 and 1948 seasons. After the affiliation with the Pirates ended, the 1949 Rehoboth Beach "Sea Hawks" captured the championship. Rehoboth Beach teams hosted home minor league games at the Rehoboth Beach Ball Park.
