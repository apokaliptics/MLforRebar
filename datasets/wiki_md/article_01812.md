# The Lamp (magazine)

The Lamp is an American bimonthly magazine devoted to literature, culture, and politics from a Catholic perspective. It was founded in 2020 by Matthew Walther and William Borman.
The magazine regularly features reporting, personal essays, and book reviews on a broad range of topics. It seeks "with reporting, incisive commentary, and coverage of books and the arts to bring the mind of the Church and a generous, urbane spirit to bear on the questions of modern life." The Lamp has been described by The Catholic Spirit, the official newspaper of the Catholic Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, as "a Catholic version of The New Yorker."
The magazine derives its logo from a previous English Catholic periodical of the same name, published by Thomas Earnshaw Bradley during the Victorian era.
