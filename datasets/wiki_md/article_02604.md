# Licypriya Kangujam

Licypriya Kangujam (Meitei pronunciation: [lisipɾija kaŋŋud͡ʒɐm]; born 2 October 2011) is a child environmental activist from Manipur, India. One of the youngest climate activists globally, she addressed world leaders at the 2019 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Madrid, Spain, asking them to take immediate climate action. Licypriya has been campaigning for climate action in India since 2018, to pass new laws to curb India's high pollution levels, and to make climate-change literacy mandatory in schools. She has been regarded as India's Greta Thunberg, though she does not like the usage of this term.
Licypriya started advocating against climate change in July 2018. On 21 June 2019, inspired by Greta Thunberg, Licypriya started spending a week outside the Indian parliament House to draw the attention of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to pass a climate change law in India.
