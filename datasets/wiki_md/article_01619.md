# Bloodwynd

Bloodwynd is the name of several superheroes appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character initially debuted in Justice League America #61 (April 1992), created by Dan Jurgens. Since the character's debut, several retroactive changes have established him to be three individuals, including being an alter-ego of Martian Manhunter, and having a streamlined origin over time. Bloodwynd's reception as a character was mixed; while noted for a striking design and being an African-American superhero whose powers are tied to magic, the character's name was panned as well as his reduced roles.
The first Bloodwynd (originally unrevealed) is Quintus Arce, a necromancer and descendant of African American slaves that sought retribution against their slave owner by invoking a dark ritual involving a blood sacrifice, creating a blood gem that facilitated their freedom. Martian Manhunter briefly appropriated the identity due to subtle mental coercion from the entity within the blood gem ("Rott") while Quintus foiled Rott's attempt to escape, a gambit enacted by Rott to find a power source able to allow his freedom but was defeated and the real Quintus was freed. It is revealed he was condemned to Hell after an encounter with the sorcerer Felix Faust. The second Bloodwynd is Quintus' nephew Raphael Arce, an empath whose abilities was awakened by the Lazarus rain during Lazarus Planet. He later absorbs portions of Doomsday and Martian Manhunter's souls, giving him several unique eldritch abilities.
