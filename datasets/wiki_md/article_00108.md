# RanaVision

Rana motion vision system is a motion detection that uses vision to detect the presence of objects within its visual field. Rana is based on the open source motion package for Linux, but has significantly enhanced motion detection capabilities. It has been designed top operate as an efficient camera trap system for recording the movements of small invertebrates, capable of operating autonomously in the field for extended periods. To date, Rana has been used a number of projects looking eusocial hymenoptera including studies of bumblebee and hornet activity in the vicinity of their nests
and of the behaviour of hover flies and other pollinators at flowers
and as a general purpose e-ecology tool for the automated remote observation of plant-pollinator interactions in the field.
