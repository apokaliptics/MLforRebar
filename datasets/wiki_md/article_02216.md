# Frank Robbins (trade unionist)

Frank Robbins (5 July 1895 – 31 January 1979) was an Irish trade unionist. Robbins came to prominence as a member of James Connolly's Irish Citizen Army, taking part in the Dublin Lockout in 1913 and the Easter Rising in 1916. Although Robbins did not involve himself in the ensuing Irish War of Independence or Irish Civil War, he continued to influence events in Ireland through his leadership in the trade union movement and as part of the Labour Party. During the Irish revolutionary period, Robbins was frustrated by the notion that Labour was considered outside of Irish Republicanism, rather than a strand within it. He was also frustrated by the lack of willingness by the labour movement to involve itself directly in the War of Independence. 
Although Robbins was a disciple of the syndicalist Connolly, he himself rejected communism and hardline socialism, to the point that in 1944 he followed William O'Brien and his supporters out of the Labour party and into the splinter group the National Labour Party when they accused the mainline of the party of allowing communists such as Jim Larkin into the Dublin branches of the party.
