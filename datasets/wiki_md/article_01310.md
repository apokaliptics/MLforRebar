# Isabella River (New South Wales)

Isabella River, a perennial stream that is part of the Lachlan catchment within the Murray–Darling basin, is located in the central–western region of New South Wales, Australia.
The river rises on the western slopes of the Great Dividing Range, between Isabella and Burraga, and flows generally south, south-west, north-west and west, before reaching its confluence with the Abercrombie River east of Tuena; descending 671 metres (2,201 ft) over its 51-kilometre (32 mi) course.
