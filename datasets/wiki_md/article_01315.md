# Angola–Japan relations

Relations between Angola and Japan were established in September 1976, shortly after Angola received formal sovereignty. As of 2007, economic relations played "a fundamental role in the bilateral relations between the two governments." Japan has an embassy in Luanda. Angola has an embassy in Tokyo.
