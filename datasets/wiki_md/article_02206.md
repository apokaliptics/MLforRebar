# Victory Monument (Bangkok)

Victory Monument (Thai: อนุสาวรีย์ชัยสมรภูมิ, RTGS: Anusawari Chai Samoraphum; lit. 'victorious battleground monument') is a military monument in Bangkok, Thailand. The monument was erected in June 1941 to commemorate the Thai victory in the Franco-Thai War. The monument is in Ratchathewi District, northeast of central Bangkok, at the center of a traffic circle at the intersection of Phahonyothin, Phaya Thai, and Ratchawithi roads. The area is served by Victory Monument BTS station (N3) on the Sukhumvit Line of the BTS Skytrain, which is located above Phaya Thai road. The station opened on 5 December 1999.
Since its erection in 1941, the monument has become a regular spot for protests along with the Democracy Monument, with recent protests taking place in 2022 where protesters attended rallies against Prayut Chan-o-cha.
