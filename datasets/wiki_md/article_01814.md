# Jakokoyak

Jakokoyak was a project created by Welsh musician and producer Rhys Edwards, with leanings towards psychedelic folk, sometimes classified as folktronica and lo-fi experimental electronic music. Edwards also ran the now defunct Peski Records label. He is married to musician Gwenno Saunders and lives in Cardiff, Wales.
