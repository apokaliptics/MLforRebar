# Kathy Foster (musician)

Kathleen Michelle "Kathy" Foster is an American musician best known as the bassist for the indie rock band The Thermals and drummer for the All Girl Summer Fun Band. She also performed under the name Butterfly Transformation Service.
Foster was raised Catholic in Sunnyvale, California and moved to Portland, Oregon in 1998. That summer, she joined with three friends to form the All Girl Summer Fun Band, which recorded and performed together until 2013; Foster and two other members reunited and returned to performing in 2023.
When Foster arrived in Portland in 1998, she also met Hutch Harris, joining him as a drummer and vocalist in his group Urban Legends. Foster and Harris had also performed and recorded as Haelah when, in 2002, they also created the standalone duo Hutch and Kelly. They performed under all three band names, with lineups ranging from a duo to a quartet, until settling on the name The Thermals in 2002, with Foster on bass guitar. By early 2003, The Thermals had started a career as a mainstay of the Portland indie rock scene. Foster continued to record and tour with the band until their 2018 dissolution. Foster also recorded drums on two of the band's seven albums, The Body, the Blood, the Machine (2006) and Now We Can See (2009).
As of 2012, she was the owner of the T-shirt company Daydream Factory.
