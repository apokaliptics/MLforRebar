# State Security Agency (South Africa)

The State Security Agency (SSA) is the department of the South African government with overall responsibility for civilian intelligence operations. It was created in October 2009 to incorporate the formerly separate National Intelligence Agency, South African Secret Service, South African National Academy of Intelligence, National Communications Centre, and COMSEC.
This restructuring and integration of the disparate agencies was ongoing as of 2011.
Political responsibility for the agency lies with the Minister in the Presidency; as of 2023 this is Khumbudzo Ntshavheni. The agency is headed by an acting director-general; as of 2022 this is Thembisile Majola. In the 2010/11 national budget, the secret services received a total transfer of 3,052.2 million rand. For the 2015/16 national budget, the secret services received a total transfer of 4,308.3 million rand.
The Spy Cables are a set of leaked communications published by Al Jazeera and The Guardian, derived from communications between the State Security Agency and other global intelligence agencies.
