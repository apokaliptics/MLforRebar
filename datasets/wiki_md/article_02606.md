# Port Moody station

Port Moody station was a stop on the West Coast Express commuter rail line connecting Vancouver to Mission, British Columbia, Canada. The station was located on the south side of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) tracks in Port Moody, at the north foot of Williams Street, approximately 200 metres (660 ft) north of St. John's Street. The station opened in 1995, when the West Coast Express began operating. All services were operated by TransLink.
The station closed for revenue service on December 1, 2016, coinciding with the opening of SkyTrain's Evergreen Extension the next day. Moody Centre station serves as a replacement station and continues to be served by the West Coast Express commuter rail service.
