# 2008 North Alabama Lions football team

The 2008 North Alabama Lions football team represented the University of North Alabama in the 2008 NCAA Division II football season.
UNA qualified to the Division II playoffs as a two-seed and earned a bye. They beat conference rivals Valdosta State and Delta State before losing in the semifinals to the Northwest Missouri State Bearcats.
Head coach Mark Hudspeth left the program after the season and joined the Mississippi State Bulldogs as their passing game coordinator. UNA replaced him with Terry Bowden ahead of the 2009 season.
