# Elisabeth Munksgaard

Elisabeth Munksgaard (1924 – 13 November 1997) was a Danish historian and from 1962 until retiring in 1990, the assistant Keeper in the Department of the Prehistory of Denmark at the National Museum of Denmark. She was "Denmark's acknowledged expert" on art from the late Iron Age and Viking Age.
Munksgaard's work encompassed multiple aspects of prehistoric Denmark. In 1974 she published the book Oldtidsdragter, for decades the authoritative work on ancient Scandinavian clothing. Over time her ideas developed to suggest a particular style of dress for the eleventh century King Canute, an idea so central to her scholarship that the "finale" to her career was the installation in the museum of a replica of the king. In 1984 Munksgaard furthermore identified the Tjele helmet fragment as the remnant of one of the only known Viking helmets, rather than the saddle mount it had been misidentified as for 130 years.
