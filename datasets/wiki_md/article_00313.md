# Lip Service (game show)

Lip Service is a game show that aired on MTV from February 22, 1992,  to January 3, 1993, and again from May 10, 1993, to December 17, 1994. It was hosted originally by Jay Mohr, who was followed in the position by John Ales. Both hosts were joined by a rap-style disc jockey, either Spinderella (from Salt 'N Pepa), Monie Love, or Yo! MTV Raps regular T-Money.
In each episode, two three-member teams, representing different U.S. colleges and universities, competed in a three-round lip-sync contest. Three judges evaluated the teams' efforts, each focusing on a separate aspect: accuracy, body mechanics (later changed to "sass"), and overall performance.
