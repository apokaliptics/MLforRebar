Originally, NAMM was founded in Houston, Texas by president Herb Fritch.  In 1995, NAMM was sold to publicly traded company PhyCor Inc. of Nashville, TN.  PhyCor filed for bankruptcy in 2002, but the filing did not include NAMM's operations.  This allowed the company to keep the name and reemerge as a subsidiary of a newly founded company, Aveta, Inc., in that same year.  Aveta was a new company with no affiliation to PhyCor or the original NAMM leadership.  NAMM is a subsidiary of Aveta out of Fort Lee, New Jersey.
