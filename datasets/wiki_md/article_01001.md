# NDH-2

NDH-2, also known as type II NADH:quinone oxidoreductase or alternative NADH dehydrogenase, is an enzyme (EC: 1.6.99.3) which catalyzes the electron transfer from NADH (electron donor) to a quinone (electron acceptor), being part of the electron transport chain. NDH-2 are peripheral membrane protein, functioning as dimers in vivo, with approximately 45 KDa per subunit and a single FAD as their cofactor.
NDH-2 are the only enzymes, with NADH dehydrogenase activity, expressed in the respiratory chain of some pathogenic organisms (e.g. Staphylococcus aureus), and for that they have been proposed as new targets for rational drug design.
