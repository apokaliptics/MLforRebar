# Afrin Canton

The Afrin Canton (Kurdish: Kantona Efrînê; Arabic: مقاطعة عفرين; Classical Syriac: ܦܠܩܐ ܕܥܦܪܝܢ, romanized: Pelqā dha-ʻAfrin) was one of the cantons of Rojava. Syria's Afrin District fell under the control of the People's Protection Units (YPG) around 2012 and an "Afrin Canton" (later Afrin Region) was declared in 2014. Afrin Canton in its latest form was established in 2017, however, as part of the reorganisation of Rojava's subdivisions. With Afrin as its administrative centre, the canton was part of the larger Afrin Region. As a result of Operation Olive Branch in early 2018, Afrin Canton became part of the Turkish occupation of northern Syria. The government of the Afrin Region was subsequently confined to the area around Tell Rifaat.
