# Ionic conductivity (solid state)

Ionic conductivity (denoted by λ) is the movement of ions through a solid material, a phenomenon central to solid-state ionics. It is denoted by λ and measured in siemens per meter (S/m). While perfect crystals of inorganic compounds are typically electrical insulators, ionic conduction arises when defects are introduced—either intrinsically through thermal activation or extrinsically via doping with aliovalent impurities. These defects enable ion migration by providing pathways through the crystal lattice. Solid ionic conductors, known as solid electrolytes, are critical components in technologies such as all-solid-state batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, and thin-film microelectronic devices. The ionic conductivity (σ) follows an Arrhenius-type relationship with temperature, governed by activation energy barriers influenced by crystal structure and defect chemistry. Ionic conduction is one mechanism of current.
