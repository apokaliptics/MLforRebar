# Musée de l'Histoire de France (Versailles)

The Musée de l'Histoire de France (French pronunciation: [myze d(ə) listwaʁ də fʁɑ̃s] ; "Museum of French History") is a museum that was created by King Louis Philippe I in the Palace of Versailles and opened in 1837. At the time, it represented an ambitious project of national reconciliation between the hitherto competing narratives of the French monarchy and the French Revolution, to which Louis-Philippe devoted significant personal attention. Whereas it gradually faded in importance as a museum in the later 19th century, its lavish historicist decoration remains a major exemplar of the art of France's July Monarchy.
