# Langenberg transmission tower

The Langenberg transmission tower (also translated as "Sender Langenberg" or "Transmission Facility Langenberg") is a broadcasting station for analog FM Radio and Digital-TV (DVB-T2 HD) signals. It is located in Langenberg, Velbert, Germany and owned and operated by Westdeutscher Rundfunk, WDR.
The history of the transmitting site is very changing. The transmitter first went into service in 1927 with 60 kilowatts (kW) of power and a T-aerial hanging on two 100-metre freestanding steel-frame towers insulated against ground.
