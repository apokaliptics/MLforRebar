# J. L. Mauthe

The SS J.L. Mauthe, was originally a straight-deck bulk carrier steamship, hull #298, built in 1952 by the Great Lakes Engineering Works on the River Rogue, Michigan site and delivered to its owner, Interlake Steamship Company. The SS J.L. Mauthe operated as a self-propelled vessel for 46 years. Upon conversion into a barge, it was renamed as Pathfinder and is currently active on the lakes as an articulated tug-barge unit, paired with the Z-drive tug Dorothy Ann with a home port of Cleveland, Ohio.
