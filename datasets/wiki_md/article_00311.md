# Boxing at the 2019 SEA Games

Boxing at the 2019 SEA Games in the Philippines was held at the Philippine International Convention Center Forum in Pasay, Metro Manila from 4 to 9 December 2019.
Host Philippines emerged as the overall champion for the first time since 2005 after winning seven gold, three silver and two bronze medals. Twelve of 13 Filipino entries went on to win medals with Olympians Rogen Ladon and Charly Suarez and 2019 AIBA World Championships silver medalist Eumir Marcial leading the way.
World champions Josie Gabuco and Nesthy Petecio led the women’s squad with a gold medal apiece. Gabuco won a record fifth SEA Games gold medal while Petecio finally tasted success after being denied the top prize in 2013 and 2015. The only Filipino fighter who failed to bring home a medal was defending light heavyweight champion John Marvin, who lost to Vietnam’s Truong Dinh Hoang in the quarterfinals. Marvin was knocked down in the first round and went on to lose the bout via split decision.
Thailand, led by Chatchai Butdee and Wuttichai Masuk, finished second overall with five gold medals. Vietnam was the only other nation to win a gold medal in boxing, courtesy of Nguyen Thi Tam in the women’s flyweight division.
