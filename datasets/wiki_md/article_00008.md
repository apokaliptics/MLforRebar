# 1956 Burmese general election

General elections were held in Burma on 27 April 1956 to elect the 250 members of the Burmese Chamber of Deputies. However, voting did not take place for 48 seats in which the Anti-Fascist People's Freedom League (AFPFL) candidates ran unopposed.
The AFPFL, a former wartime resistance organisation, won the elections with a reduced majority. After the election, U Nu, leader of the AFPFL, temporarily retired to reform the party and its policies.
The second part of the election to elect members to the Chamber of Nationalities took place on 22 May after the election commission stated that "rebel intimidation and the lack of security prevented the people from exercising freedom of choice". Voter turnout was 48%.
