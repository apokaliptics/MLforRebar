# Between the Species

Between the Species: A Journal for the Study of Philosophy and Animals (formerly Between the Species: A Journal of Ethics and Between the Species: An Online Journal for the Study of Philosophy and Animals, also known as BTS) is a peer-reviewed academic journal devoted to philosophical examinations of human relationships with other animals. It is, in part, a continuation of Ethics & Animals (E&A), a journal which ran from 1980 to 1984. Between the Species was founded as a print journal in 1985, published by the Schweitzer Center of the San Francisco Bay Institute/Congress of Cultures. The print version ceased publication in 1996. It was revived as an open access online-only journal in 2002. It is published by the Philosophy Department and Digital Commons at the California Polytechnic State University; Joseph Lynch is the current editor-in-chief.
