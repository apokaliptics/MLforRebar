# Miró otro

Miró otro, originally spelled backwards as Orim, was a retrospective of the Catalan painter Joan Miró's work organized by Official College of Architects of Catalonia (COAC) at its headquarters in Barcelona during April–June 1969. One of the most important and transgressors of this exhibit was the art intervention made by the artist and collaborators before the opening of the exhibition, and destroyed by him and collaborators later.
