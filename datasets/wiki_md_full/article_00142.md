2015 German film directed by David Wnendt



***Look Who's Back*** ([German](/wiki/German_language "German language"): ***Er ist wieder da***, pronounced [[ˈeːɐ̯ ʔɪst ˈviːdɐ daː]](/wiki/Help:IPA/Standard_German "Help:IPA/Standard German"); transl. "He's back again") is a 2015 German [satirical](/wiki/Satirical_film "Satirical film") [black comedy film](/wiki/Black_comedy_film "Black comedy film") directed by [David Wnendt](/w/index.php?title=David_Wnendt&action=edit&redlink=1 "David Wnendt (page does not exist)") [[de](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Wnendt "de:David Wnendt")] and based on the 2012 novel [of the same name](/wiki/Look_Who%27s_Back "Look Who's Back") by [Timur Vermes](/wiki/Timur_Vermes "Timur Vermes").[[4]](#cite_note-4) It is a work of [political satire](/wiki/Political_satire "Political satire") about [Adolf Hitler](/wiki/Adolf_Hitler "Adolf Hitler") waking up in the modern era, and his attempts to reintegrate with modern German society and politics.

The film features unscripted vignettes of [Oliver Masucci](/wiki/Oliver_Masucci "Oliver Masucci") as Adolf Hitler interacting with ordinary Germans, interspersed with scripted storyline sequences.[[5]](#cite_note-Lee-5)

It was listed as one of eight films that could have been the German submission for the [Best Foreign Language Film](/wiki/Academy_Award_for_Best_Foreign_Language_Film "Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film") at the [89th Academy Awards](/wiki/89th_Academy_Awards "89th Academy Awards"), but it was not selected.[[6]](#cite_note-Germany-6)

## Plot

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Look_Who%27s_Back_(film)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Plot")]

In 2014, Adolf Hitler wakes up in the [Berlin](/wiki/Berlin "Berlin") park where his [Führerbunker](/wiki/F%C3%BChrerbunker "Führerbunker") once stood. Disoriented, he wanders through the city, interpreting modern situations from a wartime perspective. Mistaken for an [impersonator](/wiki/Impersonator "Impersonator"), Hitler encounters a [mime](/wiki/Mime "Mime") and an anxious young mother, the latter of which [pepper-sprays](/wiki/Pepper-spray "Pepper-spray") him. He faints after reading a newspaper stating the year is 2014.

Meanwhile, at the MyTV television station offices, leading executive Christoph Sensenbrink is denied a promotion. Unleashing his rage, he fires Fabian Sawatzki, a [freelance](/wiki/Freelancer "Freelancer") filmmaker. Sitting at home, Sawatzki spots Hitler in the background of his documentary footage and his mother suggests that a film about him would be successful. As Hitler wakes up at a newspaper kiosk, he reads about a changed Germany and laments the loss of his vision. Believing destiny has a purpose for him, Hitler decides to continue his work, and eventually he is found by Sawatzki.

Sawatzki proposes filming Hitler for [YouTube](/wiki/YouTube "YouTube") and they embark on a journey across Germany. Hitler interacts with ordinary Germans and speaks to them about contemporary social and political issues. Sawatzki's idea for an animal-centric film clip ends abruptly when the normally animal-loving Hitler shoots a dog after it bites him.

Sawatzki introduces Hitler and his program idea to MyTV executives, including the new managing director, Katja Bellini (who got the promotion Sensenbrink desired). Bellini supports Hitler and his ideas while Sensenbrink is opposed. Hitler learns about the Internet and obsessively reads Wikipedia. On air, he speaks about the problems in modern German society which he noticed during his journey. The speech is remixed and talked about by various famous [YouTubers](/wiki/YouTuber "YouTuber"), unintentionally becoming a comedy hit.

Hitler meets with various right wing [fringe parties](/wiki/Fringe_party "Fringe party") and laments that none of them have the rhetoric or leadership skills that he has. Meanwhile, Sensenbrink sends an anonymous complaint of incitement of [racial violence](/wiki/Racial_violence "Racial violence") to the public prosecutor, summoning police at the MyTV offices, only for the prosecutor to personally praise the show and dismiss the complaint as leftist drivel.

However, Sensenbrink finds the unedited footage of Hitler shooting the dog, and in an act of revenge broadcasts it during Hitler's next interview. This causes Hitler, Sawatzki and Bellini to all be fired from the station.

Hitler publishes a book titled "*[Er Ist Wieder Da](/wiki/Look_Who%27s_Back "Look Who's Back")*" ("*He is Back*") about his new life, which becomes a popular bestseller, despite the controversy he has garnered for shooting the dog. Sawatzki [turns Hitler's book into a film](/wiki/Self-reference "Self-reference").

3 months later, without Hitler, MyTV's ratings plummet. In a fit of rage, which parodies a scene from *[Downfall](/wiki/Downfall_(2004_film) "Downfall (2004 film)")*, Sensenbrink ultimately decides to finance the film.

During filming, Hitler is attacked by [Neo-Nazis](/wiki/Neo-Nazism "Neo-Nazism") who mistake him for a mocking impersonator. Hitler is hospitalized, and when news of this generates sympathy for him, his popularity soars. Sawatzki reviews his footage and travels to the spot where Hitler rose from the ground.

He discovers burnt leaves and a sign that the Führerbunker once stood at that location. Sawatzki realizes Hitler is not an impersonator and goes to confront him at the hospital, but Hitler has already been discharged, and only Bellini is in the room. Sawatzki tries to explain the truth to her, but she does not believe the story and hospital staff begins to chase him.

At the MyTV set, Hitler is filming when he is interrupted by Sawatzki holding him at gunpoint. Hitler allows Sawatzki to direct them to the rooftop, where Sawatzki shoots him off the side of the building. Hitler reappears behind him, unharmed, and the confrontation is revealed to be a [film scene](/wiki/Story_within_a_story "Story within a story") with an actor playing Sawatzki; the real Sawatzki had been committed to a mental hospital.

As Hitler's film finishes, he senses a political comeback. In the final scene, he and Bellini ride in a car through Berlin. The music tone changes sharply when bystanders begin performing the [Nazi salute](/wiki/Nazi_salute "Nazi salute") at him, and the film intersperses his monologue with clips of real-life contemporary far-right protests and interviews with politicians such as [Marine Le Pen](/wiki/Marine_Le_Pen "Marine Le Pen"). Hitler says to himself: "I can work with this."

## Production

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Look_Who%27s_Back_(film)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Production")]

The scene in which Sensenbrink rages about the network's failing performance parodies a scene from *[Downfall](/wiki/Downfall_(2004_film) "Downfall (2004 film)")* that became popular through [internet parodies](/wiki/Downfall_(2004_film)#Parodies "Downfall (2004 film)").

## Box office

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Look_Who%27s_Back_(film)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Box office")]

The film was a box office success, reaching number one in [Germany](/wiki/Germany "Germany") in its third week of release.[[7]](#cite_note-7)

## Reception

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Look_Who%27s_Back_(film)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Reception")]

Jörg Albrecht wrote on the [Deutschlandfunk](/wiki/Deutschlandfunk "Deutschlandfunk") website that, as a media satire, the film could certainly hold its own with *[Schtonk!](/wiki/Schtonk! "Schtonk!")*. However, the laughter could quickly fade when one realizes that “the German culture of welcome also applies to Adolf Hitler.”[[8]](#cite_note-8)

In the online edition of the [Frankfurter Rundschau](/wiki/Frankfurter_Rundschau "Frankfurter Rundschau"), Daniel Kothenschulte wrote: “At first it's not really funny, and then it's not painful enough.” The film adaptation of the bestseller squanders great documentary moments in favor of a bland media satire.[[9]](#cite_note-9)

Michael Hanfeld described the film adaptation of the novel on FAZ.NET as “the stupidest and most perfidious film to hit cinemas in a long time.” The film wants to be a satire, but in reality it is “an experimental arrangement and a pamphlet.”[[10]](#cite_note-10)

The German Film and Media Evaluation (FBW) awarded the film the rating “particularly valuable.”[[11]](#cite_note-11)

## Remake

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Look_Who%27s_Back_(film)&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Remake")]

The film was remade in Italy as *[Sono tornato](/wiki/I%27m_Back_(film) "I'm Back (film)")* (*I'm Back*) in 2018. The plot closely follows the German film except that it is [Benito Mussolini](/wiki/Benito_Mussolini "Benito Mussolini") rather than Hitler who magically reappears in the 21st century.
