Edited and updated by Weenix curator Anke Van Wagenberg, PhD, aka Anke A. Van Wagenberg-Ter Hoeven, author of Jan Baptist Weenix & Jan Weenix: The Paintings (Waanders 2018)

**Jan Baptist Weenix**, also spelled **Jan Baptiste Weeninx**[[1]](#cite_note-1) (1621–{1659}}), was a painter of the [Dutch Golden Age](/wiki/Dutch_Golden_Age "Dutch Golden Age"). Despite his relatively brief career, he was a very productive and versatile painter. His favourite subjects were Italian landscapes with large figures among ruins, seaside views, and, later in life, large [still life](/wiki/Still_life "Still life") pictures of dead game or dogs. He was mainly responsible for introducing the Italian harbor scene into Dutch art, in mid-size paintings with a group of figures in the foreground.

## Life

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Jan_Baptist_Weenix&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Life")]

Weenix was born near Amsterdam's harbor, the son of an [architect](/wiki/Architect "Architect").[[2]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChisholm1911-2)
He could not speak well, apparently from a medical condition, and because he very much liked to read books, his mother sent him to work for a bookseller, who was not able to deal with him.
He drew whenever he could, according to [Jan Weenix](/wiki/Jan_Weenix "Jan Weenix") his son, who told the story to [Arnold Houbraken](/wiki/Arnold_Houbraken "Arnold Houbraken").

Weenix first studied under [Jan Micker](/wiki/Jan_Micker "Jan Micker"), who was the brother-in-law of his oldest sister Lysbeth. He then studied in [Utrecht](/wiki/Utrecht_(city) "Utrecht (city)") under [Abraham Bloemaert](/wiki/Abraham_Bloemaert "Abraham Bloemaert"), and later back in Amsterdam under [Claes Corneliszoon Moeyaert](/wiki/Claes_Corneliszoon_Moeyaert "Claes Corneliszoon Moeyaert").
In 1639, he married Josijntje d'Hondecoeter, the daughter of [Gillis d'Hondecoeter](/wiki/Gillis_d%27Hondecoeter "Gillis d'Hondecoeter").[[3]](#cite_note-3) In 1643, Weenix travelled to Rome with [Nicolaes Pieterszoon Berchem](/wiki/Nicolaes_Pieterszoon_Berchem "Nicolaes Pieterszoon Berchem"), who had also studied with Moeyaert.[[2]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChisholm1911-2)
He had left his home in secret, but his wife traced him to [Rotterdam](/wiki/Rotterdam "Rotterdam"). He was allowed to stay away for four months.
In Rome, he became a member of the [Bentvueghels](/wiki/Bentvueghels "Bentvueghels") with the name *Ratel* (meaning rattle, because a voice defect), and was much esteemed and worked for [Pope Innocent X](/wiki/Pope_Innocent_X "Pope Innocent X").[[2]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChisholm1911-2)
He returned to Amsterdam after four years; his wife had refused to come to Rome.

In 1649, he became master of the [guild of St. Luke](/wiki/Guild_of_St._Luke "Guild of St. Luke") in Utrecht,[[2]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChisholm1911-2) and also painted a portrait of [René Descartes](/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes").
When his brother-in-law [Gijsbert d'Hondecoeter](/wiki/Gijsbert_d%27Hondecoeter "Gijsbert d'Hondecoeter") died, he trained his nephew [Melchior d'Hondecoeter](/wiki/Melchior_d%27Hondecoeter "Melchior d'Hondecoeter"), together with his own son [Jan Weenix](/wiki/Jan_Weenix "Jan Weenix"). Weenix rented the castle [Ter Mey](/w/index.php?title=Ter_Mey&action=edit&redlink=1 "Ter Mey (page does not exist)") [[nl](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ter_Mey_(Haarzuilens) "nl:Ter Mey (Haarzuilens)")] at [Haarzuilens](/wiki/Haarzuilens "Haarzuilens") outside Utrecht, to concentrate on his work or for health reasons (plague).[[4]](#cite_note-4) On 25 April 1659 the inventory of his estate was auctioned off.[[5]](#cite_note-5) His widow, who had been living on Wittevrouwenstraat, in Utrecht, was buried on 6 October 1662.[[6]](#cite_note-6)

He painted a few religious scenes, one of the rare pieces of this kind being the "Jacob and Esau" ([Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister](/wiki/Gem%C3%A4ldegalerie_Alte_Meister "Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister"), [Dresden](/wiki/Dresden "Dresden")). In the [National Gallery, London](/wiki/National_Gallery,_London "National Gallery, London"), is a "Hunting Scene" by Weenix, and Glasgow has a characteristic painting of ruins. Weenix is represented at most of the important continental galleries, notably at Munich, Vienna, Berlin, Amsterdam, and St Petersburg.[[2]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEChisholm1911-2)
