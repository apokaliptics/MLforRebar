It was race 5 of 10 in both the [1965 World Championship of Drivers](/wiki/1965_World_Championship_of_Drivers "1965 World Championship of Drivers") and the [1965 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers](/wiki/1965_International_Cup_for_Formula_One_Manufacturers "1965 International Cup for Formula One Manufacturers").

## Race report

The race itself was dramatic. Clark led away from pole with Hill close behind. With 16 laps to go, the BRM driver had begun experiencing brake issues and was 35 seconds adrift of the leading Lotus. Then the Scot started to lose oil pressure, which was getting worse every lap. Clark – thinking fast – chose to nurse his car to the finish by killing the engine through the fast corners. This meant that he lost at least 2 seconds per lap, which allowed Hill to close up rapidly. At the chequered flag, Clark was still running, but his lead had shrunk to a mere 3 seconds.[[1]](#cite_note-1) As of 2025[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=1965_British_Grand_Prix&action=edit), this was the last British Grand Prix to have an all British podium.
