## Biography

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Frank_Battaglia&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Biography")]

Battaglia was the only [Italian-American](/wiki/Italian-American "Italian-American") police commissioner of Baltimore, controlling a police department previously dominated by [Irish-American](/wiki/Irish-American "Irish-American") police officers during a time period nicknamed the "Holy Roman Empire."[[2]](#cite_note-2) Battaglia would lose the post for a consultant position in 1984 to [Bishop L. Robinson](/wiki/Bishop_L._Robinson "Bishop L. Robinson") as Mayor [Donald Schaefer](/wiki/Donald_Schaefer "Donald Schaefer") shifted control of the department to the city's majority [African American](/wiki/African_American "African American") community.[[3]](#cite_note-3) It was under Battaglia that former BPD officer [Gary D'Addario](/wiki/Gary_D%27Addario "Gary D'Addario") was elevated to the rank of lieutenant. D'Addario is best known as the shift commander featured in [David Simon](/wiki/David_Simon "David Simon")'s [Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets](/wiki/Homicide:_A_Year_on_the_Killing_Streets "Homicide: A Year on the Killing Streets") book and was the inspiration for the character of [Al Giardello](/wiki/Al_Giardello "Al Giardello") seen on [NBC](/wiki/NBC "NBC")'s [Homicide: Life on the Street](/wiki/HLOTS "HLOTS"). During the [Baltimore riot of 1968](/wiki/Baltimore_riot_of_1968 "Baltimore riot of 1968"), Battaglia was ranked as a Lieutenant Colonel and was the Department's official Field Force Commander.[[4]](#cite_note-4)
