## History

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=SHARK_Conference&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

The name SHARK is an acronym representing the first letter of its 5 charter members. (**S**[outh Beloit](/wiki/South_Beloit_High_School "South Beloit High School"), **H**[arlem](/wiki/Harlem_High_School_(Illinois) "Harlem High School (Illinois)"), **A**[quin](/wiki/Aquin_Catholic_Schools "Aquin Catholic Schools"), **R**[ockton Hononegah](/wiki/Hononegah_Community_High_School "Hononegah Community High School") and **K**[irkland-Hiawatha](/wiki/Kirkland-Hiawatha_High_School "Kirkland-Hiawatha High School")) The SHARK originated as a collection of schools in northern Illinois based primarily on proximity and not on enrollment. By 1953, Kirkland-Hiawatha left the conference and was replaced with [Harvard](/wiki/Harvard_High_School_(Illinois) "Harvard High School (Illinois)") and [Marengo](/wiki/Marengo_Community_High_School "Marengo Community High School"), taking the total number of teams to six. In 1955 Freeport Aquin left the conference, however Rockford St. Thomas High School took their place. The conference continued to morph as the 1950s came to a close with [North Boone High School](/wiki/North_Boone_Community_Unit_School_District_200 "North Boone Community Unit School District 200") joining in 1957 and [Richmond-Burton](/wiki/Richmond-Burton_Community_High_School "Richmond-Burton Community High School") in 1958. Also in 1958, based on the completion of [Boylan Catholic High School](/wiki/Boylan_Catholic_High_School "Boylan Catholic High School"), St. Thomas dropped out of the conference as their students began transitioning toward a new high school, and Harlem left the league in order to join the [Big 8 Conference](/wiki/Northern_Illinois_Conference_(athletic_conference) "Northern Illinois Conference (athletic conference)") with the intent of playing competition with similar enrollments.

As the 1960s began, [Alden-Hebron High School](/wiki/Hebron,_Illinois#Education "Hebron, Illinois") joined, however, it quickly left in 1964 along with Richmond-Burton. The following season, [Winnebago High School](/wiki/Winnebago_High_School "Winnebago High School") and two [Beloit, Wisconsin](/wiki/Beloit,_Wisconsin "Beloit, Wisconsin") schools joined the conference. The two schools from Wisconsin included; [Beloit Catholic High School](/w/index.php?title=Beloit_Catholic_High_School&action=edit&redlink=1 "Beloit Catholic High School (page does not exist)") and [Turner High School](/wiki/F._J._Turner_High_School "F. J. Turner High School"). Winnebago remained a member of the league until 1972 but left for the [Mid Northern Conference](/wiki/Big_Northern_Conference "Big Northern Conference"). [Amboy High School](/wiki/Amboy_High_School "Amboy High School") quickly replaced them in 1972, but left after the 1975 season, heading to the newly formed [Three Rivers Conference](/wiki/Three_Rivers_Conference_(Illinois) "Three Rivers Conference (Illinois)"). In 1978, [Johnsburg High School](/wiki/Johnsburg_High_School "Johnsburg High School") joined the league and in 1981, the conference's final season, [Woodstock Marian](/wiki/Marian_Central_Catholic_High_School "Marian Central Catholic High School") would be added. However, North Boone, Beloit Catholic, and South Beloit all left the conference before the start of the season, leaving the conference with only five teams in its final season.[[2]](#cite_note-2)
