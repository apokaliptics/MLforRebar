All three ringside announcers from [EPIX](/wiki/Epix "Epix") scored the fight in favour of Huck.

Huck came close to dropping Povetkin in the final round.[[18]](#cite_note-18)[[19]](#cite_note-19) After the fight, Povetkin admitted, "I underestimated him. Perhaps I didn't take this fight seriously enough." Huck said, "A lot of people who saw this fight see me as the winner." It was reported that Huck had injured his right between rounds 6 and 7.

#### Huck vs. Głowacki

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Marco_Huck&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Huck vs. Głowacki")]

Huck was due to make history against undefeated [Krzysztof Głowacki](/wiki/Krzysztof_G%C5%82owacki "Krzysztof Głowacki"), as it was to be his fourteenth defense, a new record. The bout took place on 14 August 2015 in Huck's American debut at the [Prudential Center](/wiki/Prudential_Center "Prudential Center") in [Newark, New Jersey](/wiki/Newark,_New_Jersey "Newark, New Jersey"), on [Premier Boxing Champions](/wiki/Premier_Boxing_Champions "Premier Boxing Champions").

The three judges scorecards read 118–109, 117–110, and 116–111 in favour or Briedis.[[43]](#cite_note-43)[[44]](#cite_note-44) Huck confirmed he would not be retiring despite his fourth career loss.

When Usyk was asked why he chose Huck, he replied that it was because of his fans. Huck, also excited about the fight, said, "This was my wish opponent." The fight, would be contested for Usyk's WBO cruiserweight title.[[48]](#cite_note-48) On July 26, it was announced that the fight would take place at the [Max-Schmeling-Halle](/wiki/Max-Schmeling-Halle "Max-Schmeling-Halle") in Berlin on 9 September 2017. This would mark the second time Usyk would fight in Germany in his professional career, having fought there on his third professional bout in April 2014. It would also mark the first fight of the tournament.[[49]](#cite_note-49)[[50]](#cite_note-50)[[51]](#cite_note-51)

On 6 September, at the final press conference, Huck pushed Usyk in the face-off. In regards to the shove, Huck said, "I wanted to show Usyk that he is in my hometown and that he should be prepared for the battle of his life on Saturday." Usyk, who remained professional and calm, replied, "If you want to be a great champion, you have to beat the best and Huck is one of the best. I chose to enter this tournament because it is a path to achieve my dream of unifying all the belts. There's a prestigious trophy at stake too, the Muhammad Ali Trophy. We were born on the same day and I admire Ali because he is the biggest role model in boxing and I will thank God if I win a trophy with his name on it."[[52]](#cite_note-52) As he was leaving the building, Usyk claimed he would 'bury' Huck.[[53]](#cite_note-53)

On fight night, Usyk used his footwork and combination punching to cruise to a TKO win. On top of his dominant performance, Usyk taunted Huck throughout the fight. In round 8, Usyk tripped on Huck's feet and Huck lost a point on the scorecards as he threw a punch at Usyk when the latter was down. Usyk continued to land combinations with little to no response from Huck until referee Robert Byrd stopped the fight in the tenth round. With the win, Usyk progressed to the semi-final stage of the Super Series and is slated to face the winner of the [Mairis Briedis](/wiki/Mairis_Briedis "Mairis Briedis")–[Mike Perez](/wiki/Mike_Perez_(boxer) "Mike Perez (boxer)") fight.
