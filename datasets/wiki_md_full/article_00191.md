He was born in [Garvald, East Lothian](/wiki/Garvald,_East_Lothian "Garvald, East Lothian"), the son of Rev Archibald Blair, the local minister.

In 1773 he was apprenticed to Dr Francis Balfour, a [naval surgeon](/wiki/Ship%27s_doctor "Ship's doctor"), and served in the [Royal Navy](/wiki/Royal_Navy "Royal Navy") in the [West Indies](/wiki/West_Indies "West Indies"). On return to Scotland he studied medicine at the [University of Edinburgh](/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh "University of Edinburgh") and qualified as a doctor in 1785.

Robert Blair was the first Regius Professor of [Astronomy](/wiki/Astronomy "Astronomy") at the [University of Edinburgh](/wiki/University_of_Edinburgh "University of Edinburgh") (1785 until death). He invented the [aplanatic](/wiki/Aplanatic "Aplanatic") [lens](/wiki/Lens_(optics) "Lens (optics)") and also coined this term. This was a significant step in reducing the [aberration in optical systems](/wiki/Aberration_in_optical_systems "Aberration in optical systems"). He also experimented with hollow lenses, holding different solutions.

He was elected a Fellow of the [Royal Society of Edinburgh](/wiki/Royal_Society_of_Edinburgh "Royal Society of Edinburgh") in 1786.

He died in [Westloch, Berwickshire](/w/index.php?title=Westloch,_Berwickshire&action=edit&redlink=1 "Westloch, Berwickshire (page does not exist)") on 22 December 1828.[[1]](#cite_note-1)
