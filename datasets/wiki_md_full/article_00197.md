In 2009, the community service parts of Hammersmith and Fulham, Kensington and Chelsea, and Westminster [primary care trusts](/wiki/Primary_care_trust "Primary care trust") merged, as part of the [Transforming Community Services](/wiki/Transforming_Community_Services "Transforming Community Services") initiative. This combined organisation was established as an NHS trust on 1 November 2010.[[2]](#cite_note-2) The organisation merged with Barnet Community Services on 1 April 2011.

It has a back-office support contract with [Capita](/wiki/Capita "Capita") for IT, estates and facilities management services.[[3]](#cite_note-3)

It ran the Soho Square and Milne House general practices in Westminster but abandoned the loss-making contracts in July 2014.[[4]](#cite_note-4)

It was named by the [Health Service Journal](/wiki/Health_Service_Journal "Health Service Journal") as one of the top hundred NHS trusts to work for in 2015. At that time it had 2577 full-time equivalent staff and a sickness absence rate of 4.04%. 64% of staff recommend it as a place for treatment and 53% recommended it as a place to work.[[5]](#cite_note-5)

In April 2016 it took over community service for Merton CCG practices.
