1986 American TV series or program

***Attitudes*** is an American [television](/wiki/Television "Television") [talk show](/wiki/Talk_show "Talk show") on [Lifetime](/wiki/Lifetime_(TV_network) "Lifetime (TV network)") that aired from October 6, 1986 to December 1992. Hosted originally by [Linda Dano](/wiki/Linda_Dano "Linda Dano") and [Nancy Glass](/wiki/Nancy_Glass "Nancy Glass"), it was taped before a live studio audience at [EUE Screen Gems](/wiki/EUE_Screen_Gems "EUE Screen Gems") Studios, 222 East 44th Street in [New York City](/wiki/New_York_City "New York City"). Glass was replaced by singer Dee Kelly following the show's second season, as Glass left to host the nationally syndicated primetime magazine show *This Evening*. The show then moved to [Kaufman Astoria Studios](/wiki/Kaufman_Astoria_Studios "Kaufman Astoria Studios") in Queens. Dano's co-host later changed once more, with [Jerry Penacoli](/wiki/Jerry_Penacoli "Jerry Penacoli"), who is now host of *[Extra](/wiki/Extra_(American_TV_program) "Extra (American TV program)")*. The show by this time had evolved into more of a tabloid talk format. Dano, uncomfortable with the changes, left the show. Penacoli was subsequently fired from the show. Both were replaced with [Dorothy Lucey](/wiki/Dorothy_Lucey "Dorothy Lucey") and [Rolonda Watts](/wiki/Rolonda_Watts "Rolonda Watts") as the new co-hosts. The show's audience, unable to accept the loss of Dano as well as disliking the change in format, quickly dropped off and *Attitudes* was canceled soon after.

*Attitudes* was the first national talk show hosted by two women and was written about during its tenure in such publications as *[The New York Times](/wiki/The_New_York_Times "The New York Times")* and *[Vogue](/wiki/Vogue_(magazine) "Vogue (magazine)")* and parodied on *[Saturday Night Live](/wiki/Saturday_Night_Live "Saturday Night Live")* with [Nora Dunn](/wiki/Nora_Dunn "Nora Dunn") as Dano and [Jan Hooks](/wiki/Jan_Hooks "Jan Hooks") as Kelly. With its first hosts, Linda Dano and Nancy Glass, the show was nominated for a [Daytime Emmy](/wiki/Daytime_Emmy_Award "Daytime Emmy Award") in the category of [Outstanding Talk Show](/wiki/Daytime_Emmy_Award_for_Outstanding_Talk_Show "Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show") but lost to [Sally Jessy Raphael](/wiki/Sally_Jessy_Raphael "Sally Jessy Raphael")'s eponymous *[Sally](/wiki/Sally_(1983_talk_show) "Sally (1983 talk show)")*. They were the first cable hosts to be nominated in this category.

The show featured numerous celebrity guests from the worlds of entertainment, fashion, and politics. One of the stranger episodes of the show, featuring an incredibly flexible 84-year-old woman, Barbara Moseley,[[1]](#cite_note-1) was famously featured in the music video for the [Coldplay](/wiki/Coldplay "Coldplay") song "[The Hardest Part](/wiki/The_Hardest_Part_(Coldplay_song) "The Hardest Part (Coldplay song)")." The band was digitally inserted into the footage.
