NBA professional basketball team season

NBA professional basketball team season

The **1977–78 [New Orleans Jazz](/wiki/New_Orleans_Jazz_(NBA_team) "New Orleans Jazz (NBA team)") season** was the team's fourth in the NBA. They began the season hoping to improve upon their 35–47 output from the [previous season](/wiki/1976%E2%80%9377_New_Orleans_Jazz_season "1976–77 New Orleans Jazz season"). They started the season going 6-2 and later in the season with a 16–24 record, the team managed to go on a 10-game winning streak and we're still in a playoff hunt with a 36–37 record before a 6-game losing streak dashed any playoff hopes for the fourth straight season, but still they finished the season with a 3-game winning streak and improved their 35-47 one year earlier by four wins, finishing 39–43.[[1]](#cite_note-1)
