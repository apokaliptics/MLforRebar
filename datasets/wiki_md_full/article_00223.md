***Tugu Muda*** ("Youth Monument") is a stone monument in [Semarang](/wiki/Semarang "Semarang"), [Central Java](/wiki/Central_Java "Central Java") commemorating the struggle for independence by [Indonesian](/wiki/Indonesia "Indonesia") youth.[[1]](#cite_note-1) It was dedicated by President [Sukarno](/wiki/Sukarno "Sukarno") on 20 May 1953 to commemorate the continuous [five-day battle](/wiki/Battle_of_Semarang "Battle of Semarang") between the youth of Semarang and a Japanese battalion led by Major Kido from 14 to 19 October 1945.

Japanese forces drove the Dutch from Indonesia as the "elder brother of Asia"; however, the Japanese were crueler to dissidents than their Dutch counterparts.[[2]](#cite_note-2)

The stone monument consists of a foundation, body and head. One side of the monument is done in [relief](/wiki/Relief "Relief"), with ornamental ponds and gardens surrounding it.
