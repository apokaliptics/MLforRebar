Observatory in Chile

The **Southern Astrophysical Research** (**SOAR**) telescope is a modern 4.1-meter-aperture (13 ft) optical and [near-infrared](/wiki/Near-infrared "Near-infrared") telescope located on [Cerro Pachón](/wiki/Cerro_Pach%C3%B3n "Cerro Pachón"), Chile, at 2,738 metres (8,983 ft) elevation. It was commissioned in 2003, and is operated by a consortium including the countries of [Brazil](/wiki/Brazil "Brazil") and [Chile](/wiki/Chile "Chile"), [Michigan State University](/wiki/Michigan_State_University "Michigan State University"), the [Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory](/wiki/Cerro_Tololo_Inter-American_Observatory "Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory") (CTIO) (part of the [National Optical Astronomy Observatory](/wiki/National_Optical_Astronomy_Observatory "National Optical Astronomy Observatory"), NOAO), and the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](/wiki/University_of_North_Carolina_at_Chapel_Hill "University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill"). Partners have guaranteed shares varying from 10 to 30 percent of the observing time.

The telescope uses [active optics](/wiki/Active_optics "Active optics") on its primary and secondary mirrors to attain median image quality 0.7 arcsec at a wavelength of 500 nm. Multiple instruments are available on standby, mounted at unusually high weight-capacity [Nasmyth](/wiki/Nasmyth_telescope "Nasmyth telescope") foci and two lower capacity bent-[Cassegrain](/wiki/Cassegrain_reflector "Cassegrain reflector") foci. Switching is accomplished within a few minutes by rotating the 45° tertiary mirror. The pointing of this mirror is adjusted at high speed to prevent image blur from vibrations induced by wind-shake of the telescope structure.

## Overview

Its optical specifications are:

* M1 total diameter 4300mm
* Entrance Pupil Diameter 4100mm
* Pupil central Obstruction 980mm
* M1 [working f/#](/wiki/F-number#Working_f-number "F-number") 1.6855 (no prime focus is available)
* [Focal plane working f/#](/wiki/F-number#Working_f-number "F-number") 16.625
* [Effective Focal Length](/wiki/Focal_length#General_optical_systems "Focal length") 68176.3mm
* Gamma ratio (dZ(foc)/dZ(M2)) 100.5

## Instruments

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Southern_Astrophysical_Research_Telescope&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Instruments")]

Current (5/2014) instruments are:

* UV–optical 16-million pixel imager (SOI, CTIO)
* near-infrared (1–2.4 μm wavelength) 1-million pixel [HgCdTe](/wiki/HgCdTe "HgCdTe") imager and spectrograph (OSIRIS, Ohio State University/CTIO)
* UV–optical 16-million pixel imager and spectrograph (Goodman Spectrograph, UNC)
* near-infrared (1–2.4 μm wavelength) 16-million pixel HgCdTe imager (SPARTAN, MSU)
* adaptive optics module (SAM, CTIO)

Additional facility instruments are being commissioned:

* UV–optical 16-million pixel integral-field spectrograph (SIFS, Brazil)

User instruments are employed by individual astronomers or teams but not available to all users.

US astronomers access the telescope remotely over the [Internet 2](/wiki/Internet_2 "Internet 2"). Chilean and Brazilian astronomers use their high-speed networks. An on-site operator controls where the telescope points while the remote astronomer controls the instrument and data retrieval.

The SOAR telescope dome is a $2 million, 66-foot-diameter (20 m), weatherproof structure weighing over 70 tons.[[2]](#cite_note-2)
