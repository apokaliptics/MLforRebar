[Woolston](/wiki/Woolston,_Cheshire "Woolston, Cheshire") is a [civil parish](/wiki/Civil_parishes_in_England "Civil parishes in England") in the [Borough of Warrington](/wiki/Borough_of_Warrington "Borough of Warrington") in [Cheshire](/wiki/Cheshire "Cheshire"), England, and is a suburb to the east of the town of [Warrington](/wiki/Warrington "Warrington"). It contains four buildings that are recorded in the [National Heritage List for England](/wiki/National_Heritage_List_for_England "National Heritage List for England") as designated [listed buildings](/wiki/Listed_building "Listed building"), all of which are listed at Grade II. This is the lowest of the three gradings given to listed buildings, applied to "buildings of national importance and special interest".[[1]](#cite_note-1) The parish is almost entirely residential, and the [A57 road](/wiki/A57_road "A57 road") runs through it. One of the listed buildings is a milestone on the road, and the others are a church, a pair of cottages, and a single cottage.
