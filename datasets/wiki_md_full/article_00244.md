In the documentary, 18-year-old [Franak Viačorka](/wiki/Franak_Viacorka "Franak Viacorka"), a youth activist with the [Belarusian Popular Front](/wiki/Partyja_BPF "Partyja BPF"), and his friends prepare for the run-up to the 2006 presidential election. Their activities range from handing out newspapers, organising rock concerts, distributing flyers, composing protest songs and interviewing [Alaksandar Milinkievič](/wiki/Alaksandar_Milinkievi%C4%8D "Alaksandar Milinkievič"), opposition candidate. Aside from the main theme of the elections, it also touches briefly on the incarceration of Franak's father, [Vincuk Viačorka](/wiki/Vincuk_Via%C4%8Dorka "Vincuk Viačorka"), a professor at the banned [Belarusian Humanities Lyceum](/wiki/Belarusian_Humanities_Lyceum "Belarusian Humanities Lyceum"), where Franak and many of his friends were students.

Events come to a climax on the night of the election results, March 19. Following the suspicious landslide victory of Lukashenko, opposition activists and supporters [take to the streets in protest](/wiki/Jeans_Revolution "Jeans Revolution"), many of them setting up a 'tent city' in October Square in [Minsk](/wiki/Minsk "Minsk"). By the night of March 23, riot police are deployed to clear the remaining protesters.

Two days later on March 25, [Belarusian Independence Day](/wiki/Freedom_Day_(Belarus) "Freedom Day (Belarus)") riot police clash violently with anti-Lukashenko demonstrators, detaining several, among them Alaksandar Milinkievič. By the end of the film, Franak's father has been released from detention, the battle has temporarily been lost, but the people's spirit is unquenched. According to Franak, the end is nigh for Lukashenko.
