## History

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tengr%C3%A9la_Department&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

Tengréla Department was created in 1980 as a first-level subdivision via a split-off from [Boundiali Department](/wiki/Boundiali_Department "Boundiali Department").[[3]](#cite_note-3)

In 1997, [regions](/wiki/Regions_of_Ivory_Coast "Regions of Ivory Coast") were introduced as new first-level subdivisions of Ivory Coast; as a result, all departments were converted into second-level subdivisions. Tengréla Department was included in [Savanes Region](/wiki/Savanes_Region_(Ivory_Coast) "Savanes Region (Ivory Coast)").

In 2011, [districts](/wiki/Districts_of_Ivory_Coast "Districts of Ivory Coast") were introduced as new first-level subdivisions of Ivory Coast. At the same time, regions were reorganised and became second-level subdivisions and all departments were converted into third-level subdivisions. At this time, Tengréla Department became part of [Bagoué Region](/wiki/Bagou%C3%A9_Region "Bagoué Region") in [Savanes District](/wiki/Savanes_District "Savanes District").
