Sports club in London, England

**Enfield Croquet Club** is a sports group in [Greater London](/wiki/Greater_London "Greater London"), England.

Following a [croquet](/wiki/Croquet "Croquet") course run by [Enfield London Borough Council](/wiki/Enfield_London_Borough_Council "Enfield London Borough Council"), those completing the course were offered the chance to form a club,[[1]](#cite_note-1) and in 1991 Enfield Croquet Club was established in [Bush Hill Park](/wiki/Bush_Hill_Park "Bush Hill Park") recreation ground, between Lincoln Road and Southbury Road, in the [London Borough of Enfield](/wiki/London_Borough_of_Enfield "London Borough of Enfield").

At first only association croquet was played, but later in 2005 golf croquet was introduced. The club currently has three full size lawns and its members compete in various inter-club association and golf croquet competitions around the south east of England.

The club is a full member of the [Croquet Association](/wiki/Croquet_Association "Croquet Association"), the national governing body for the sport.
