[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Serhiy_Leshchenko&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Biography")]

In 2003, Leschenko graduated the Institute of Journalism at the [Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv](/wiki/Taras_Shevchenko_National_University_of_Kyiv "Taras Shevchenko National University of Kyiv").[[4]](#cite_note-4) His career in journalism began in 2000 after the probation at the news program *Reporter* on the *[Novyi Kanal](/wiki/Novyi_Kanal "Novyi Kanal")* channel chaired by [Andriy Shevchenko](/wiki/Andriy_Shevchenko_(politician) "Andriy Shevchenko (politician)"). In September 2000, he became a correspondent of the online version of the newspaper *[Ukrainska Pravda](/wiki/Ukrainska_Pravda "Ukrainska Pravda")*. He continued working at the regional news department of "*Novyi Kanal*" until Spring 2001 while working for *Ukrainska Pravda*. In March 2001 he quit working for *Novyi Kanal*. In 2002 he became deputy editor-in-chief of the *Ukrainska Pravda*. Leschenko is famous for his [investigative journalism](/wiki/Investigative_journalism "Investigative journalism") on [corruption in Ukrainian politics](/wiki/Corruption_in_Ukraine#Political_corruption "Corruption in Ukraine"). In 2010 he joined the movement "Stop Tsenzuri!" ("Stop Censorship!") aimed for the protection of free speech, prevention of censorship and obstruction of journalism in Ukraine.[[5]](#cite_note-5)

In 2012, Leschenko joined a [civil movement "Chesno"](/wiki/Civil_movement_%22Chesno%22 "Civil movement \"Chesno\"") aiming for transparency and accountability of government officials. In 2012 he studied in the [United Kingdom](/wiki/United_Kingdom "United Kingdom") as a part of a scholarship program of John Smith Fellowship. In 2013–2014 he undertook an internship at the [National Endowment for Democracy](/wiki/National_Endowment_for_Democracy "National Endowment for Democracy") in [Washington D.C.](/wiki/Washington_D.C. "Washington D.C.") through the [Reagan–Fascell Democracy Fellowship](/wiki/Reagan%E2%80%93Fascell_Democracy_Fellowship "Reagan–Fascell Democracy Fellowship"). In 2013 he took part in the Draper Hills Summer Fellowship at [Stanford University](/wiki/Stanford_University "Stanford University") in the United States.

In 2014, Leschenko was elected a people's deputy to the [8th Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada](/wiki/8th_Ukrainian_Verkhovna_Rada "8th Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada") with the party [Petro Poroshenko Bloc "Solidarity"](/wiki/European_Solidarity "European Solidarity"). He chaired a subcommittee on International Partnership and Anticorruption Law Implementation as part of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on Corruption Prevention and Counteraction.

From 2015 to 2016, Leschenko was lecturing journalism at the [Ukrainian Catholic University](/wiki/Ukrainian_Catholic_University "Ukrainian Catholic University") (Lviv)[[6]](#cite_note-6) and delivering a course of lectures on anticorruption at [National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy](/wiki/National_University_of_Kyiv-Mohyla_Academy "National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy").

In June 2013, Leschenko published a documentary book the "American saga of Pavlo Lazarenko" based on the US law enforcement agencies' investigation materials.[[7]](#cite_note-7) After the [Euromaidan](/wiki/Euromaidan "Euromaidan") Leschenko wrote another book the "Mezhyhirya Syndrome. Diagnoses of [Viktor Yanukovych](/wiki/Viktor_Yanukovych "Viktor Yanukovych") Ruling", which was published in September 2014.[[8]](#cite_note-8)

Since 2017, Leschenko has his video blogs live on channel "24", where he talks about the current political situation in Ukraine, opens up his political activity and presents the agenda of the modern reformists.[[9]](#cite_note-645187TVSL-9) Since September 2018, on the same "24", Leschenko presents the political talk show "What was this" with journalist [Yevgeniya Motorevska](/w/index.php?title=Yevgeniya_Motorevska&action=edit&redlink=1 "Yevgeniya Motorevska (page does not exist)").[[9]](#cite_note-645187TVSL-9)

### Parliamentary activities

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Serhiy_Leshchenko&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Parliamentary activities")]

On 27 November 2014, Serhiy Leschenko became a people's deputy of the [8th Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada](/wiki/8th_Ukrainian_Verkhovna_Rada "8th Ukrainian Verkhovna Rada"). He was elected as a member of the [Petro Poroshenko Bloc](/wiki/European_Solidarity "European Solidarity") (No 19). In the Ukrainian parliament, he became a member of the Committee on preventing and combating corruption.[[10]](#cite_note-10) Leschenko became a member of the Interfactional union "[Eurooptimists](/wiki/Eurooptimists "Eurooptimists")".[[11]](#cite_note-11)

In 2015, Leschenko became a co-author of the bill "The changes to be made to certain legislation acts of Ukraine about preventing and counteracting corruption". The bill foresees a decrease in the risks of political corruption due to complex changes to Ukrainian legislation in the sphere of political parties and pre-election agitation direct financing that increases parties' financial dependency. The bill was a part of the "visa free package" laws, necessary for the liberalization of [visa free regime for Ukraine](/wiki/Visa_requirements_for_Ukrainian_citizens "Visa requirements for Ukrainian citizens").[[12]](#cite_note-12)[[13]](#cite_note-13)

On 26 November 2015, Leschenko presented the documents that he believed had justified the criminal case in [Switzerland](/wiki/Switzerland "Switzerland") on bribery and money laundering. The case was begun against then people's deputy from the "[People's Front](/wiki/People%27s_Front_(Ukraine) "People's Front (Ukraine)")" party Mykola Martynenko. Due to the data provided, [Mykola Martynenko](/wiki/Mykola_Martynenko "Mykola Martynenko") was placed under investigation.[[14]](#cite_note-14)

In fall 2017, together with other people's deputies and civil society representatives, Leschenko held an agitation campaign in support of "Vseukrayinskyi zbir" initiative, which had its focus on "a large political reform". The main points of the reform were a creation of an anticorruption court, abolition of deputies' immunity, a switch to a proportional representation election system with open lists. Serhiy advocates for putting a limit on pre-electoral agitation campaigns on television, which will increase the candidates' ability to compete.

In 2017, Leschenko publicly revealed that Prosecutor General of Ukraine [Yuriy Lutsenko](/wiki/Yuriy_Lutsenko "Yuriy Lutsenko") had not been receiving members of the public as was required by legislation.[[15]](#cite_note-15)[[16]](#cite_note-16) This caused the Prosecutor General to start receiving members of the public.

After election to the Verkhovna Rada, Leschenko gradually began to criticize the Petro Poroshenko Bloc (PPB) more and more and stopped voting in sync with it.[[17]](#cite_note-47402659NZLout2-17) According to deputy head of the PPB faction [Oleksiy Honcharenko](/wiki/Oleksiy_Honcharenko "Oleksiy Honcharenko"), by February 2019 Leschenko had not attended PPB faction meetings for several years.[[17]](#cite_note-47402659NZLout2-17) On 28 February 2019, Leschenko voluntarily left the Petro Poroshenko Bloc "Solidarity" faction.[[17]](#cite_note-47402659NZLout2-17)

In April 2019 Leschenko advised the [newly elected](/wiki/2019_Ukrainian_presidential_election "2019 Ukrainian presidential election") Ukrainian President [Volodymyr Zelensky](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelensky "Volodymyr Zelensky")'s transition team.[[18]](#cite_note-65863043Leshchenko-18) But he has since been distanced by the administration and Zelensky himself.[[18]](#cite_note-65863043Leshchenko-18)

On 29 May 2019 Leschenko stated he wanted to take part in the July [2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election](/wiki/2019_Ukrainian_parliamentary_election "2019 Ukrainian parliamentary election") for the party [Servant of the People](/wiki/Servant_of_the_People_(political_party) "Servant of the People (political party)") but this party stated on 7 June 2019 that no incumbent [MPs](/wiki/People%27s_Deputy_of_Ukraine "People's Deputy of Ukraine") would be on its party list for the 2019 parliamentary election.[[19]](#cite_note-19) Instead Leschenko tried to win back his seat in the 220th electoral district in Kyiv.[[20]](#cite_note-20) But Leschenko failed to do this, taking third place with 11.98% (7,775 votes). Instead, Servant of the People candidate [Hanna Bondar](/wiki/Hanna_Bondar "Hanna Bondar") won the district with 37%.[[21]](#cite_note-21)

#### The real estate scandal

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Serhiy_Leshchenko&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: The real estate scandal")]

On 6 September 2016, a group of deputies of the Verkhovna Rada appealed to the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU) with a request to check the purchase of Serhiy Leschenko of an apartment of 192 m² in a new building on Ivan Franko Street in the center of Kyiv.[[22]](#cite_note-BBC20160907-22) At that time, the cost of the apartment was [UAH](/wiki/Ukrainian_hryvnia "Ukrainian hryvnia") 12.864 million ([USD](/wiki/US_dollar "US dollar") 480 thousand).[[23]](#cite_note-23) Other sources say that the apartment is worth UAH 7.5 million.[[24]](#cite_note-24) According to Leshchenko, half of the amount was borrowed from the chief editor of the *[Ukrainska Pravda](/wiki/Ukrainska_Pravda "Ukrainska Pravda")* [Olena Prytula](/wiki/Olena_Prytula "Olena Prytula"), in the form of an [interest](/wiki/Interest "Interest")-free cash loan for 10 years, the rest was personal funds of Leschenko and his girlfriend, famous Ukrainian DJ Anastasiya Topolska.[[25]](#cite_note-25) This apartment purchase has caused a great public outcry. Criticism has undergone both the fact of luxury purchasing, as well as sources of financing.[[22]](#cite_note-BBC20160907-22)

The seller of this apartment was the Asset Management Company Industrial Investments LLC, which is indirectly related to the oligarch [Dmytro Firtash](/wiki/Dmytro_Firtash "Dmytro Firtash").[[26]](#cite_note-26) In 2011, this legal entity initiated the [bankruptcy](/wiki/Bankruptcy "Bankruptcy") of the state chemical plant Sumykhimprom.[[27]](#cite_note-27) Subsequently, thanks to the bankruptcy process, the oligarch Dmytro Firtash gained control over the chemical enterprise.[[28]](#cite_note-28)

On 19 September 2016, NABU reported an administrative violation with signs of corruption in the Leschenko case: Pritula's loan could be qualified as a [gift](/wiki/Gift "Gift"), and its receipt contradicts the Ukrainian anti-corruption legislation (restriction on the receipt of gifts by deputies). In addition, USD 77 thousand were spent from the deposits of Serhiy Leschenko's mother, which wasn't stated in the deputy's declaration as his own funds.[[29]](#cite_note-29)

On 15 February 2017, Pechersky District Court of Kyiv closed an administrative case, not finding *[corpus delicti](/wiki/Corpus_delicti "Corpus delicti")* in Leschenko's actions.[[30]](#cite_note-30) Judge Volodymyr Karabanʹ, who made the court decision, together with his family members, was repeatedly involved in scandals.[[31]](#cite_note-31)[[32]](#cite_note-32)[[33]](#cite_note-33)

#### Fight at the Verkhovna Rada

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Serhiy_Leshchenko&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Fight at the Verkhovna Rada")]

On 9 February 2017, people's deputy from the Petro Poroshenko Bloc Ivan Melnychuk started a verbal dispute with Serhiy Leschenko in the session hall of the Verkhovna Rada. The dispute started over a [Facebook](/wiki/Facebook "Facebook") post written by Leschenko, wherein he claimed deputies from PPB faction were purposely deteriorating the anticorruption committee meetings so that they could accuse the committee of being a failure later. Ivan Melnychuk used physical force and damaged Leschenko's suit.[[34]](#cite_note-34)[[35]](#cite_note-35)[[36]](#cite_note-36)

#### Case of Paul Manafort

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Serhiy_Leshchenko&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Case of Paul Manafort")]

In August 2016, Serhiy Leshchenko announced that the [Party of Regions](/wiki/Party_of_Regions "Party of Regions"), shortly before [Viktor Yanukovych](/wiki/Viktor_Yanukovych "Viktor Yanukovych")'s election as the President of Ukraine, paid to the American political consultant [Paul Manafort](/wiki/Paul_Manafort "Paul Manafort") for his services.[[37]](#cite_note-Gordonua18082016-37) According to Leshchenko, the expenses of Ukraine related to his activities exceeded $ 12 million.[[38]](#cite_note-38) In February 2017, correspondence between allegedly Leshchenko and Paul Manafort's daughter Jess appeared on the Internet. This correspondence, posted by anonymous hackers in English with [grammatical errors](/wiki/Linguistic_prescription "Linguistic prescription"), was perceived by one Russian media outlet as [blackmail](/wiki/Blackmail "Blackmail").[[39]](#cite_note-39)

Manafort confirmed the authenticity of the texts hacked from his daughter's phone. He added that he had received similar texts to his own phone number from the same address appearing to be affiliated with Leshchenko. He also said he did not respond directly to those letters, but resend them to his lawyer. Manafort refused to show these messages to journalists.[[40]](#cite_note-40)

In March 2017, Leshchenko surrendered to the [NABU](/wiki/National_Anti-Corruption_Bureau_of_Ukraine "National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine") documents[[a]](#cite_note-42) that, presumably, could prove Manafort's involvement in offshore schemes.[[42]](#cite_note-BBC20170322-43)[[43]](#cite_note-44)[[44]](#cite_note-ukrpravda-45) These documents showed a $750,000 payment for the supply of 501 [computers](/wiki/Computer "Computer") to a company *David Manafort*, from a [Belize](/wiki/Belize "Belize")-registered offshore company, through a bank in [Kyrgyzstan](/wiki/Kyrgyzstan "Kyrgyzstan"). Leshchenko urged to begin an investigation of this situation both in Ukraine and in the [USA](/wiki/United_States "United States").[[42]](#cite_note-BBC20170322-43)[[44]](#cite_note-ukrpravda-45) In March 2019, Manafort "was convicted on eight criminal counts including [bank fraud](/wiki/Bank_fraud "Bank fraud"), [tax fraud](/wiki/Tax_evasion "Tax evasion") and failing to file a foreign bank account report." Together with the [court sentence](/wiki/Sentence_(law) "Sentence (law)") of 2018, the total sentence of Manafort was 7.5 years.[[45]](#cite_note-46)

At the beginning of Donald Trump's presidency, Manafort demanded that the White House and [Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump") actively pressure Ukrainian officials to investigate and discredit Leshchenko because Leshchenko had published information highly critical of Manafort's political consulting work in Ukraine.[[46]](#cite_note-MurrayWaas25092019-47)[[47]](#cite_note-MurrayWaas08102019-48) Manafort provided information to [Rudy Giuliani](/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani "Rudy Giuliani") to smear Leshchenko and entered into a joint legal defense agreement between Manafort's attorneys and Trump's attorneys.[[46]](#cite_note-MurrayWaas25092019-47) Manafort and Giuliani also discussed how to deal with [Marie Yovanovitch](/wiki/Marie_Yovanovitch "Marie Yovanovitch").[[46]](#cite_note-MurrayWaas25092019-47)

On 10 May 2019, 107th [Mayor of New York City](/wiki/Mayor_of_New_York_City "Mayor of New York City") and attorney to US President [Donald Trump](/wiki/Donald_Trump "Donald Trump"), [Rudolf Giuliani](/wiki/Rudy_Giuliani "Rudy Giuliani"), announced that he had hoped to meet in [Kyiv](/wiki/Kyiv "Kyiv") with Ukrainian president-elect, [Volodymyr Zelensky](/wiki/Volodymyr_Zelensky "Volodymyr Zelensky"). They planned to discuss foreign countries interference in the [2016 U.S. presidential election](/wiki/2016_United_States_presidential_election "2016 United States presidential election"), as well as the involvement of [Hunter Biden](/wiki/Hunter_Biden "Hunter Biden") (son of 47th [vice president of the United States](/wiki/Vice_President_of_the_United_States "Vice President of the United States") [Joe Biden](/wiki/Joe_Biden "Joe Biden")) at *[Burisma](/wiki/Burisma_Holdings "Burisma Holdings")*, a gas company owned by a Ukrainian oligarch [Mykola Zlochevsky](/wiki/Mykola_Zlochevsky "Mykola Zlochevsky"). However, the next day Giuliani canceled his trip. Giuliani said that there are enemies of the US President in the election headquarters of Zelensky. "I'm not going to go because I think I'm walking into a group of people that are enemies of the president, in some cases, enemies of the United States. And in one case already convicted person who has found to be involved in assisting of the Democrats in the 2016 elections... Gentleman by the name of Leschenko who supplied a *Blackbook*," said Giuliani in an interview with *[Fox News](/wiki/Fox_News "Fox News")*.[[48]](#cite_note-49)[[49]](#cite_note-50)[[50]](#cite_note-51)[[51]](#cite_note-52) At around this time the Zelensky administration (whom Leshchenko had been advising) started to distance itself from Leshchenko reportedly because of concerns about being seen as too close to him while he was attracting criticism from Giuliani.[[18]](#cite_note-65863043Leshchenko-18)

Leshchenko said that the Prosecutor General, [Yuriy Lutsenko](/wiki/Yuriy_Lutsenko "Yuriy Lutsenko"), was to blame for the scandalous situation, he rejected the accusation of forging "black bookkeeping" materials.[[52]](#cite_note-53)[[53]](#cite_note-54) In response, Lutsenko said that "Leshchenko, often on a not-free-of-charge basis from the [US Embassy in Ukraine](/wiki/Embassy_of_the_United_States,_Kyiv "Embassy of the United States, Kyiv") kicked up a row this scandal, trying to help one of the presidential candidates in 2016" and he called Leshchenko a "political [skunk](/wiki/Mephitidae "Mephitidae")".[[54]](#cite_note-55)[[55]](#cite_note-56)[[56]](#cite_note-57)

#### Fight on television

After being live on the "Newsone" channel [Ihor Mosiychuk](/wiki/Ihor_Mosiychuk "Ihor Mosiychuk") accused Leschenko of discrediting [Oleh Lyashko](/wiki/Oleh_Lyashko "Oleh Lyashko"), who was leading (the parliamentary party) [Radical Party](/wiki/Radical_Party_of_Oleh_Lyashko "Radical Party of Oleh Lyashko").[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*] The quarrel outgrew into a fight.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]
