The [school rivalry](/wiki/School_rivalry "School rivalry") in sports between [Ateneo de Manila University](/wiki/Ateneo_de_Manila_University "Ateneo de Manila University") and [De La Salle University](/wiki/De_La_Salle_University "De La Salle University") began when both educational institutions participated in the [Philippine National Collegiate Athletic Association](/wiki/National_Collegiate_Athletic_Association_(Philippines) "National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines)") (NCAA) and has carried over to the [University Athletic Association of the Philippines](/wiki/University_Athletic_Association_of_the_Philippines "University Athletic Association of the Philippines") (UAAP) where both universities compete in currently.[[1]](#cite_note-2)

Beginning with [UAAP Season 84](/wiki/UAAP_Season_84 "UAAP Season 84") in May 2022, Ateneo de Manila University decided to unify student-athletes and varsity teams under the "[Blue Eagles](/wiki/Ateneo_Blue_Eagles "Ateneo Blue Eagles")" moniker moving forward, regardless of sport, gender, or age group.[[2]](#cite_note-3)[[3]](#cite_note-4)[[4]](#cite_note-5)[[5]](#cite_note-6) Meanwhile, the Green Archer is the traditional mascot of De La Salle University and the varsity teams are collectively referred to as the "[Green Archers](/wiki/De_La_Salle_Green_Archers_and_Lady_Archers "De La Salle Green Archers and Lady Archers")", however, each team carries a specific moniker that references the sport that they play.[[6]](#cite_note-7)

Ateneo and La Salle were both co-founders of the NCAA in 1924,[[7]](#cite_note-8)[[8]](#cite_note-9) until Ateneo left the league in 1978 to join the UAAP while La Salle announced its decision to leave the NCAA in a press conference in September 1980, effective after the then ongoing 1980–81 NCAA Season.[[9]](#cite_note-ateneo_transfer-10)[[10]](#cite_note-lasalle_transfer-11) Both Catholic private schools in the [Metro Manila](/wiki/Metro_Manila "Metro Manila") area have been competing against each other in the UAAP ever since La Salle was also admitted to join the league in 1986.[[11]](#cite_note-timeline-12)

## History

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ateneo%E2%80%93La_Salle_rivalry&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

The rivalry began in 1939 when Ateneo lost to La Salle in a hotly contested championship basketball game in NCAA Season 16 (1939–40).[[12]](#cite_note-13) Basketball games between Ateneo and La Salle in the old NCAA were always hard-fought, but they were not yet tagged by local sportswriters as a recognized rivalry. The more popular collegiate sports rivalries in the NCAA were Ateneo versus San Beda and La Salle versus Letran.[[13]](#cite_note-spot.ph-14)[[14]](#cite_note-15)

When Ateneo and La Salle transferred to the UAAP in 1978 and 1986 respectively, they naturally continued their fierce battles and innate animosity against each other on and off-court, and the sports press began to recognize the rivalry.[[15]](#cite_note-NY-16)[[16]](#cite_note-explainer-17) The rivalry started with the men's basketball games and has since expanded to other UAAP sports, particularly in women's volleyball where both teams fought head-to-head in the UAAP Finals for six consecutive times from 2012 to 2017.[[11]](#cite_note-timeline-12) Both universities have also extended their rivalry beyond sports and have gone into academic competitions.[[17]](#cite_note-18)

From 1924 to 1925, basketball games between Ateneo and La Salle were played at an open basketball court at the Padre Faura, Ermita campus of UP, and in 1926 at the Nozaleda Park (now called Agrifina Circle which is part of [Luneta Park](/wiki/Luneta_Park "Luneta Park")). The venue later moved to the covered courts of the US Army's 31st Infantry Gym and UST Gym.[[18]](#cite_note-19) The games then moved to the pre-war [Rizal Memorial Coliseum](/wiki/Rizal_Memorial_Coliseum "Rizal Memorial Coliseum") to accommodate bigger crowds, and at one point, the venues included the Ateneo Loyola Center, the [Cuneta Astrodome](/wiki/Cuneta_Astrodome "Cuneta Astrodome"), and the [PhilSports Arena](/wiki/PhilSports_Arena "PhilSports Arena"). Currently, the [Smart Araneta Coliseum](/wiki/Araneta_Coliseum "Araneta Coliseum") and the [SM Mall of Asia Arena](/wiki/SM_Mall_of_Asia_Arena "SM Mall of Asia Arena") are the present main venues for their sold-out games.[[19]](#cite_note-esq-20)

### Collegiate titles of national scope

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ateneo%E2%80%93La_Salle_rivalry&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Collegiate titles of national scope")]

In terms of collegiate titles of national scope, Ateneo leads with five titles to La Salle's three. Ateneo won the Collegiate Champions League (CCL) title in 2007, and won back to back titles in the Philippine Collegiate Championship League (PCCL) in the 2009 and 2010 seasons, as well as in the 2018 and 2019 seasons. La Salle won the Philippine Intercollegiate Championship in 1988 and the Philippine Collegiate Championship in 2008 and 2013 against Ateneo and the [South Western University](/wiki/Southwestern_University_(Philippines) "Southwestern University (Philippines)") Cobras, respectively.[[24]](#cite_note-25)[[25]](#cite_note-26)

Ateneo won the 2007 Collegiate Champions League title against the [University of the Visayas](/wiki/University_of_the_Visayas "University of the Visayas") Green Lancers, 71–54. The [Collegiate Champions League](/wiki/Collegiate_Champions_League "Collegiate Champions League") (CCL), was then reformatted and became the [Philippine Collegiate Championship League](/wiki/Philippine_Collegiate_Championship_League "Philippine Collegiate Championship League") (PCCL). It is currently the national collegiate basketball championship tournament, sanctioned by the [Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas](/wiki/Samahang_Basketbol_ng_Pilipinas "Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas"), the country's official basketball federation. College teams from all over the country participate in the tournament. The tournament also has a Sweet 16 similar to the United States' NCAA basketball tournament during "March Madness."

The Green Archers won the 2008 PCCL title. La Salle defeated the second-seeded NCAA champion [San Beda Red Lions](/wiki/San_Beda_Red_Lions_basketball "San Beda Red Lions basketball") and arranged a finals meeting with the top-seeded UAAP champion Ateneo Blue Eagles, who defeated the [Letran Knights](/wiki/Letran_Knights_basketball "Letran Knights basketball") in the Final Four. In the championship match, the De La Salle Green Archers prevailed over the Ateneo Blue Eagles, 71–62.

In the 2009 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Blue Eagles defeated the [FEU Tamaraws](/wiki/FEU_Tamaraws_basketball "FEU Tamaraws basketball") in three games to clinch their second national title, whereas the Green Archers were eliminated by the Letran Knights in their first game in the round of 16. In the 2010 season, the Blue Eagles defeated the [Adamson Soaring Falcons](/wiki/Adamson_Soaring_Falcons_basketball "Adamson Soaring Falcons basketball") in three games to clinch their third and back-to-back national titles, while the Green Archers settled for 3rd-place beating the [University of Cebu](/wiki/University_of_Cebu "University of Cebu") Webmasters despite having 4 players injured and only 10 players intact in the line-up.

In the 2013 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Green Archers defeated the South Western University Cobras, via sweep to reclaim the national championship for the first time since 2008 and winning their second title in the tournament.

In the 2018 season of the Philippine Collegiate Championship League, the Blue Eagles defeated the University of the Visayas Green Lancers, 95–71 to reclaim the national championship for the first time since 2010 and winning their fourth title in the tournament.[[26]](#cite_note-27) In the 2019 season, the Blue Eagles defeated the San Beda Red Lions 57–46 to win their fifth title in the PCCL.[[27]](#cite_note-28)

### Championship streaks

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ateneo%E2%80%93La_Salle_rivalry&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Championship streaks")]

Ateneo was 3-peat NCAA champion from 1931 through 1933, and its record of 14 collegiate titles remained unsurpassed by any school in the NCAA until 2003. They currently hold the distinction of having the longest UAAP basketball title streak in the Final Four era after winning five straight times from 2008 to 2012.[[28]](#cite_note-29) In 2019, Ateneo achieved another 3-peat and became the first team in the UAAP Final Four era to finish an entire season (including the finals) without a single loss (16–0) in the [UAAP Season 82](/wiki/UAAP_Season_82 "UAAP Season 82") men's basketball tournament.[[29]](#cite_note-30)

Both schools have also managed to post what are regarded as "double championships" by winning both the seniors and juniors titles in the same year. The Ateneo Blue Eagles still have the most number of double titles in NCAA history, with four double championships, including the NCAA's second back-to-back double championships in 1975 and 1976 (the first was accomplished by the University of the Philippines in 1925 and 1926).

Ateneo holds the distinction of being the only double 3-peat champion in the senior and junior levels whether in the NCAA or UAAP, from 2008 to 2010, and has posted two 4-peats and three back-to-back title streaks in the UAAP juniors' division.

La Salle does not have any such streaks in the NCAA, but won back-to-back titles once in 1989 and 1990, and also posted a 4-peat in UAAP men's basketball from [1998](/wiki/UAAP_Season_61 "UAAP Season 61") to [2001](/wiki/UAAP_Season_64 "UAAP Season 64").[[30]](#cite_note-31)[[31]](#cite_note-32) La Salle accomplished the double championship once during its stint in the NCAA (1939) and UAAP (2007).

The Lady Archers were able to duplicate the championship streak of the Green Archers and achieved a 4-peat of their own from [1999](/wiki/UAAP_Season_62 "UAAP Season 62") to [2002](/wiki/UAAP_Season_65 "UAAP Season 65"), which was the longest UAAP women's basketball championship streak in the Final Four era until it was surpassed by the NU Lady Bulldogs when they won seven straight championships from [2014](/wiki/UAAP_Season_77 "UAAP Season 77") to [2022](/wiki/UAAP_Season_85 "UAAP Season 85").[[32]](#cite_note-33)

La Salle holds the distinction of being the first and only school to be 3-peat UAAP basketball champions in both men's and women's divisions in the same period, from 1999 to 2001. In 2013, La Salle were champions in both divisions again in the [UAAP Season 76 basketball tournaments](/wiki/UAAP_Season_76_basketball_tournaments "UAAP Season 76 basketball tournaments").[[33]](#cite_note-34)[[34]](#cite_note-35)

### NCAA

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ateneo%E2%80%93La_Salle_rivalry&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: NCAA")]

In 1939, La Salle defeated Ateneo in both the Seniors and Juniors NCAA Championship. The school rivalry reputedly started that year when after La Salle defeated Ateneo, then the defending champions, some Lasallians allegedly mocked Ateneans by throwing fried chicken outside the gates of the Ateneo Padre Faura campus in [Manila](/wiki/Manila "Manila").[[16]](#cite_note-explainer-17)[[19]](#cite_note-esq-20)[[35]](#cite_note-guidon-36) Ateneo and La Salle would not meet in the championship again until 1958 where Ateneo defeated La Salle by a basket in overtime. One last finals meeting of both schools took place when the third rubber match series occurred in 1974 with La Salle led by future [Philippine Basketball Association](/wiki/Philippine_Basketball_Association "Philippine Basketball Association") star [Lim Eng Beng](/wiki/Lim_Eng_Beng "Lim Eng Beng") prevailing over Ateneo in the championship. Ateneo and La Salle then left the NCAA in 1978 and 1981 respectively after games turned into full-blown riots with other schools, with Ateneo leaving after losing the 1978 championship against San Beda in closed doors,[[9]](#cite_note-ateneo_transfer-10) and La Salle after fan disturbance in their 1980 second-round game against Letran.[[10]](#cite_note-lasalle_transfer-11)[[36]](#cite_note-37)

### UAAP

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ateneo%E2%80%93La_Salle_rivalry&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: UAAP")]

**1988: First Ateneo–La Salle finals in the UAAP**

In [1988](/wiki/UAAP_Season_51_men%27s_basketball_tournament "UAAP Season 51 men's basketball tournament"), Ateneo and La Salle met in their first finals match since 1974 when both teams still competed in the NCAA. Ateneo won, 76–70 at the Rizal Memorial Coliseum.[[19]](#cite_note-esq-20) Ateneo was led by [Gilbert Reyes](/wiki/Jun_Reyes "Jun Reyes") under head coach [Fritz Gaston](/wiki/Fritz_Gaston "Fritz Gaston"), while La Salle was led by [Dindo Pumaren](/wiki/Dindo_Pumaren "Dindo Pumaren") under head coach and older brother [Derrick Pumaren](/wiki/Derrick_Pumaren "Derrick Pumaren").[[37]](#cite_note-38) La Salle would win their first basketball championship in the UAAP the following year in [Season 52](/wiki/UAAP_Season_52_men%27s_basketball_tournament "UAAP Season 52 men's basketball tournament"),[[38]](#cite_note-39) while Ateneo would not win another title until 14 years later in [Season 65](/wiki/UAAP_Season_65_men%27s_basketball_tournament "UAAP Season 65 men's basketball tournament").[[13]](#cite_note-spot.ph-14)

**2001: La Salle secures fourth straight title**

La Salle was the defending three-time champion, while Ateneo were in a 13-year championship drought. La Salle won the game.[[39]](#cite_note-40) At Game 2, [Enrico Villanueva](/wiki/Enrico_Villanueva "Enrico Villanueva") scored 22 points to lead the Eagles to a series-extending win. After [Mike Cortez](/wiki/Mike_Cortez "Mike Cortez") tying the game at 72–all, Villanueva passed the ball to teammate [Magnum Membrere](/wiki/Magnum_Membrere "Magnum Membrere") who scored a [three-pointer](/wiki/Three-pointer "Three-pointer"). On the next possession, [Renren Ritualo](/wiki/Renren_Ritualo "Renren Ritualo") failed to answer with a game-tying three of his own to force a sudden-death Game 3, scoring Ateneo's first win against La Salle in the season after three games.[[40]](#cite_note-41) In the deciding game, [Carlo Sharma](/wiki/Carlo_Sharma "Carlo Sharma") scored a UAAP career-high 22 points, 11 in the final quarter to prevent an Ateneo victory. Ateneo's rookie [LA Tenorio](/wiki/LA_Tenorio "LA Tenorio") had 30 points of his own but it was not enough, as La Salle coach Pumaren remarked that "This was the sweetest of the four championships because we're able to erase the stigma of our 1988 loss to Ateneo."[[41]](#cite_note-42)[[42]](#cite_note-43)

**2002: Ateneo ends 14-year championship drought**

Prior to the Finals, Ateneo prevented a 14–0 elimination round sweep of La Salle that would have given a bye up to the best-of-three Finals. Instead, Ateneo defeated La Salle in the elimination round finale 76–63.[[43]](#cite_note-44) La Salle defeated [rival](/wiki/La_Salle-UST_rivalry "La Salle-UST rivalry") [University of Santo Tomas](/wiki/UST_Growling_Tigers_basketball "UST Growling Tigers basketball") (UST), and Ateneo overcame No. 2 seed [University of the East](/wiki/UE_Red_Warriors_basketball "UE Red Warriors basketball") (UE) in two games, with the second game ending in a buzzer beater by [Gec Chia](/wiki/Gec_Chia "Gec Chia") to push Ateneo into the Finals anew.[[44]](#cite_note-45)

Game 1 ended with Villanueva scoring Ateneo's last ten points, and teammate [Larry Fonacier](/wiki/Larry_Fonacier "Larry Fonacier") blocking two shots by [Mark Cardona](/wiki/Mark_Cardona "Mark Cardona") that would have forced overtime to give Ateneo a 1–0 series lead. In Game 2, with the Ateneo team noted as being "tense," La Salle had an 18-point lead at halftime, which Ateneo cut down to three, 80–77, but Sharma and [Adonis Santa Maria](/wiki/Adonis_Santa_Maria "Adonis Santa Maria") converted crucial free-throws that gave La Salle enough breathing space to force another Game 3. In Game 3, La Salle player [Mike Cortez](/wiki/Mike_Cortez "Mike Cortez") shot just 2-of-13 from the field for 13 points,[[45]](#cite_note-cortez-46) which caused La Salle students and alumni to accuse him of [throwing the game](/wiki/Match_fixing "Match fixing"),[[46]](#cite_note-47) as Ateneo eventually won the title to deny La Salle a fifth consecutive championship.[[15]](#cite_note-NY-16)[[47]](#cite_note-48)[[48]](#cite_note-49)

**2003–2005: Semifinals meetings**

Ateneo and La Salle would play second fiddle to [Far Eastern University](/wiki/FEU_Tamaraws_basketball "FEU Tamaraws basketball") (FEU) from [2003](/wiki/UAAP_Season_66 "UAAP Season 66") to [2005](/wiki/UAAP_Season_68 "UAAP Season 68"), with the Tamaraws defeating Ateneo in 2003, losing to La Salle in [2004](/wiki/UAAP_Season_67 "UAAP Season 67") and defeating La Salle in 2005.

Along the way, the two teams met in the semifinals, where the higher seed gets the twice-to-beat advantage. In 2003, La Salle forced No. 1 seed Ateneo into a rubber match after a 76–72 overtime win, with the game being halted after a brawl erupted between the two teams. With Ateneo's [LA Tenorio](/wiki/LA_Tenorio "LA Tenorio") and La Salle's [Ryan Araña](/wiki/Ryan_Ara%C3%B1a "Ryan Araña") suspended for the deciding game, Ateneo eliminated La Salle from Finals contention in the deciding game with a 74–68 triumph.

In [2004](/wiki/UAAP_Season_67 "UAAP Season 67"), La Salle and Ateneo finished the elimination round tied for second place, so a playoff game was played to determine which team gets the twice-to-beat advantage. La Salle won the game, and ended Ateneo's season in the semifinals, to face FEU in the Finals. La Salle would win in three games to deny FEU which had defeated Ateneo a season before, a back-to-back championship run.[[49]](#cite_note-50)

In 2005, three teams, La Salle, Ateneo and UE, were all tied for second place. La Salle won the tiebreaker with a superior point differential on games played by the three teams, causing Ateneo and UE to play for the right to face La Salle with the twice-to-win disadvantage in which the Eagles won. However, La Salle defeated Ateneo in the semifinals to clinch another Finals appearance against FEU.[[50]](#cite_note-51)

**2006: La Salle suspension**

After FEU swept La Salle in the 2005 championship series, La Salle admitted it fielded two ineligible players from 2003 to 2005, albeit it claimed not to be aware of their ineligibility which caused them to return the 2005 runner-up trophy and the 2004 championship trophy they won against FEU (the league would later award FEU the trophy).[[51]](#cite_note-52) The league suspended La Salle in [2006](/wiki/UAAP_Season_69 "UAAP Season 69") for a year due to negligence, with all of their games during that period also forfeited.[[52]](#cite_note-DLSU_suspension_1-53)[[53]](#cite_note-DLSU_suspension_2-54) Ateneo faced UST in the 2006 Finals, a series UST won in three games.[[54]](#cite_note-55)[[55]](#cite_note-56)

**2007: "Two is Greater than Three"**

Upon their return in [2007](/wiki/UAAP_Season_70 "UAAP Season 70"), UE swept the elimination round 14–0, with their last game against La Salle going into overtime with the Warriors still prevailing. With Ateneo also losing their last game, the two teams were again tied for second place, and La Salle won the playoff game to clinch the twice-to-beat advantage. Prior to this, Ateneo won the two elimination round games against La Salle.[[56]](#cite_note-57)

Unlike earlier match-ups where the team with the advantage won the first game, Ateneo won the first game, with [Chris Tiu](/wiki/Chris_Tiu "Chris Tiu") playing pivotal roles in crunch time where he scored the winning lay-up with 7.3 seconds remaining to force a deciding game.[[57]](#cite_note-GMANews.tv-58) In their fifth meeting of the season, [Pocholo Villanueva](/wiki/Pocholo_Villanueva "Pocholo Villanueva") scored a three-pointer to add La Salle's lead to nine with less than three minutes in the game left. After an Ateneo 6–2 run, Villanueva scored a jump-shot anew, padding the lead to seven. After [Ford Arao](/wiki/Ford_Arao "Ford Arao") later cut the lead to five, La Salle's OJ Cua missed two free-throws with 23.9 seconds remaining. [Chris Tiu](/wiki/Chris_Tiu "Chris Tiu") passed the ball to [Nonoy Baclao](/wiki/Nonoy_Baclao "Nonoy Baclao") who scored a three-pointer to cut the lead to two, but [JVee Casio](/wiki/JVee_Casio "JVee Casio") converted both of his free-throws with 4 seconds left to punch La Salle's ticket to the Finals.[[57]](#cite_note-GMANews.tv-58)[[58]](#cite_note-59) This had been the only time Ateneo and La Salle played for five games in a season without both the teams advancing to the Finals.

La Salle would eventually sweep UE in the Finals 2–0 to cap their seventh men's basketball championship.[[59]](#cite_note-60) After the season, La Salle coach Franz Pumaren remarked that "This is the only time that two is greater than three, they beat us three times, but we beat them when it counted the most."[[60]](#cite_note-61)[[61]](#cite_note-62)

**2008–2012: Ateneo wins five straight titles**

Ateneo would later claim their fourth UAAP title in [2008](/wiki/UAAP_Season_71 "UAAP Season 71") against defending champions La Salle by sweeping the finals series 2–0. In Game 1, [Rabeh Al-Hussaini](/wiki/Rabeh_Al-Hussaini "Rabeh Al-Hussaini") scored 31 points to lead Ateneo to a win.[[62]](#cite_note-63) In Game 2, Ateneo led by 15 points at halftime, but La Salle rallied to cut the lead down to 50–47 at the end of the third quarter. However, La Salle forward [Rico Maierhofer](/wiki/Rico_Maierhofer "Rico Maierhofer") was ejected just before the end of the quarter after the officials said that he flashed the dirty finger. Maierhofer denied the charge and revealed nine years later in 2017 that he was actually signaling for a La Salle teammate to switch places.[[63]](#cite_note-64) La Salle suffered a scoring drought which saw the lead balloon to eight in the last two minutes, and Ateneo never looked back after a [Jai Reyes](/wiki/Jai_Reyes "Jai Reyes") three-point play to secure Ateneo's fourth UAAP men's basketball title.[[64]](#cite_note-65)

La Salle paraded several rookies for the [2009](/wiki/UAAP_Season_72 "UAAP Season 72") season, while Ateneo emerged with only [Chris Tiu](/wiki/Chris_Tiu "Chris Tiu") as the major graduating player. With these conditions, the first Ateneo–La Salle game came at the heels of former [President](/wiki/President_of_the_Philippines "President of the Philippines") [Corazon Aquino](/wiki/Corazon_Aquino "Corazon Aquino")'s death, and as a result, spectators wore yellow as a sign for respect for Aquino. Ateneo outlasted La Salle in overtime to end the first round with a solitary loss. The two teams met a week later, but this time Ateneo had a big enough lead to prevent La Salle from catching up. Ateneo qualified for the semifinals as the No. 1 seed, eventually winning the championship; La Salle missed out on the Final Four on the final day after being defeated by NU. The 2009 season would be the first time Ateneo and La Salle would not meet in the playoffs since 2001, not including their Finals encounter in 2008 and the DLSU suspension in 2006.

In 2010, parading some new players and an improved set of veterans, the Green Archers defeated the Blue Eagles, 66–63, with the Blue Eagles still feeling the loss of three of the previous season's starters and sophomore guard [Sam Marata](/wiki/Sam_Marata "Sam Marata") shooting hot in the end game. This was the first official win of the Green Archers against the Blue Eagles in UAAP action since 2007. In the second round encounter, the Ateneo Blue Eagles were threatened with falling into a tie in the standings had they lost to DLSU. After falling behind 4–9, the Blue Eagles went on a 10–0 scoring run to take a double digit lead, and went on to defeat the Archers decisively, 74–57.

2010 was the second straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post eliminations series. DLSU managed to reach the Final Four after missing it in the previous season, but fell to the top-seeded FEU Tamaraws in overtime. The Blue Eagles defeated the Adamson Falcons in the Final Four, and went on to sweep the Tamaraws for their third consecutive title despite not having any player in the Mythical Team.

In 2011, the Ateneo Blue Eagles team headlined by two rookies defeated DLSU again in both of their elimination matches. It is also the third straight year that Ateneo and DLSU would not meet in a post elimination series, since the DLSU Green Archers failed to qualify once again for the Final Four. The Ateneo Blue Eagles were the top-seeded team in the semifinals and defeated the UST Growling Tigers in one game. The Blue Eagles then proceeded to sweep the Finals series against the FEU Tamaraws, thus achieving its own four-peat.

Prior to the start of the 2012 season, Norman Black announced that this would be his last season as head coach of the Ateneo. La Salle, on the other hand, had a rookie coach in [Gee Abanilla](/wiki/Gee_Abanilla "Gee Abanilla"). The two schools met thrice that season – twice in the elimination and once in the semi-finals with Ateneo winning all of the games. A few days prior to the Final 4 match between Ateneo and La Salle, the Blue Eagle's patron, [Manny Pangilinan](/wiki/Manny_Pangilinan "Manny Pangilinan"), announced that he would be pulling out his support from the school. Despite the controversy, Ateneo eventually won its fifth consecutive title, sweeping UST in the Finals.[[65]](#cite_note-66)[[66]](#cite_note-67)

**2013: La Salle reclaims the championship**

Upon the departure of Norman Black, [Dolreich "Bo" Perasol](/wiki/Bo_Perasol "Bo Perasol"), a former member of the [UP Fighting Maroons men's basketball](/wiki/UP_Fighting_Maroons_men%27s_basketball "UP Fighting Maroons men's basketball") team and a seasoned [Philippine Basketball Association](/wiki/Philippine_Basketball_Association "Philippine Basketball Association") head coach, was tapped by Ateneo as head coach of the Blue Eagles. The entry of Perasol, who was rumored to be tapped as team consultant of the UP Fighting Maroons prior to his appointment as Ateneo head coach, also heralded the return of Manny Pangilinan as the Blue Eagles' main patron. Joining Ateneo men's basketball team was Filipino-American forward [Chris Newsome](/wiki/Chris_Newsome "Chris Newsome").

Over at La Salle, a series of reshuffles within and outside of the team resulted to the appointment of then assistant coach [Juno Sauler](/wiki/Juno_Sauler "Juno Sauler") as the head coach of the Green Archers. Joining the De La Salle Green Archers coaching staff prior to the start of the 2013–14 UAAP season was [Allan Caidic](/wiki/Allan_Caidic "Allan Caidic"), who took on the chores of shooting coach. Filipino-American forwards [Jason Perkins](/wiki/Jason_Perkins "Jason Perkins") and Matthew Salem became a part of team roster, which had to adjust to the loss of resident players Yutien Andrada, [Mac Tallo](/wiki/Mac_Tallo "Mac Tallo"), [Alfonzo Gotladera](/wiki/Alfonzo_Gotladera "Alfonzo Gotladera") and Papot Paredes. For the first time since 2005, La Salle was able to sweep Ateneo during the elimination round.

During their first round meeting at the Mall of Asia Arena on July 7, 2013, the Green Archers, banking on the heroics of combo guard [Almond Vosotros](/wiki/Almond_Vosotros "Almond Vosotros") and center [Arnold Van Opstal](/wiki/Arnold_Van_Opstal "Arnold Van Opstal"), defeated the Blue Eagles, 82–73, resulting to Ateneo's third straight loss to start the season.[[67]](#cite_note-68)[[68]](#cite_note-69)[[69]](#cite_note-70) The second round meeting, which was held at the Araneta Coliseum on September 1, 2013, was tightly contested by Ateneo and La Salle, with the Green Archers winning over the Blue Eagles, 66–64, after sophomore forward Jeron Teng sank a floater with only two seconds left in the shot clock.[[70]](#cite_note-71)[[71]](#cite_note-72)[[72]](#cite_note-73) Toward the end of the second round Ateneo-La Salle game, Perasol was involved in a scuffle with JJ Atayde, an alumnus of La Salle, after the former got irked with the latter's heckling.[[73]](#cite_note-74)[[74]](#cite_note-75) The incident caused the UAAP Board to penalize Perasol with a one-game suspension and Atayde with a season-wide ban from watching games.[[75]](#cite_note-76)[[76]](#cite_note-77)

Controversy further ensued after Perasol violated his one-game suspension by watching from inside the Ateneo dugout during the Blue Eagles' September 8, 2013 game against the UE Red Warriors, forcing UE team officials to file an inquiry before the UAAP Board.[[77]](#cite_note-78)[[78]](#cite_note-79) The UAAP Board acted on UE's request for an inquiry, ordering Perasol to serve his one-game suspension during Ateneo's September 18, 2013 game against the [UST Growling Tigers](/wiki/UST_Growling_Tigers_basketball "UST Growling Tigers basketball").[[79]](#cite_note-80)[[80]](#cite_note-81) Ateneo, with Perasol serving his one-game suspension, was eventually defeated by UST, 74–82, causing the Blue Eagles to not only be dethroned as UAAP Men's Basketball Champions after five straight seasons but to also miss Final Four contention for the first time since 1998.[[81]](#cite_note-82)

La Salle, after a disappointing 3–4 finish during the first round of elimination games, swept the second round and ended the elimination round at 10–4, forcing a three-way tie for the top spot alongside the [NU Bulldogs](/wiki/NU_Bulldogs_basketball "NU Bulldogs basketball") and the [FEU Tamaraws](/wiki/FEU_Tamaraws_basketball "FEU Tamaraws basketball"). Due to having the highest quotient, NU took the Number One spot with twice-to-beat advantage and faced UST in the Final Four, with the Growling Tigers defeating the Bulldogs in two games. On the other hand, La Salle and FEU faced each other twice, the first meeting being a rubber match game for the Number Two spot and the twice-to-beat advantage and the second being the formal Final Four game, with the Green Archers winning on both occasions and entering the Finals for the first time since [UAAP Season 71](/wiki/UAAP_Season_71 "UAAP Season 71"). During the finals series, La Salle defeated UST in three games to win the [UAAP Season 76](/wiki/UAAP_Season_76_basketball_tournaments "UAAP Season 76 basketball tournaments") men's basketball championship title.[[82]](#cite_note-83)[[83]](#cite_note-84)[[84]](#cite_note-85)[[85]](#cite_note-86)

**2016: Green Archers unleash "Mayhem"**

Both Ateneo and La Salle's men's basketball teams were eliminated during the Final Four games in [2014](/wiki/UAAP_Season_77_basketball_tournaments "UAAP Season 77 basketball tournaments") and [2015](/wiki/UAAP_Season_78_basketball_tournaments "UAAP Season 78 basketball tournaments"), marking the most recent time as of 2025 that neither schools qualified to the UAAP Finals. By 2016, La Salle was able to utilize center [Ben Mbala](/wiki/Ben_Mbala "Ben Mbala"), and tapped the services of former [Letran Knights](/wiki/Letran_Knights_basketball "Letran Knights basketball") coach [Aldin Ayo](/wiki/Aldin_Ayo "Aldin Ayo") while Ateneo was on a rebuilding stage after the graduation of their top two scorers in [Kiefer Ravena](/wiki/Kiefer_Ravena "Kiefer Ravena") and [Von Pessumal](/wiki/Von_Pessumal "Von Pessumal") though they were able to get the services of former [Gilas Pilipinas](/wiki/Philippine_men%27s_national_basketball_team "Philippine men's national basketball team") coach [Tab Baldwin](/wiki/Tab_Baldwin "Tab Baldwin"). Under coach Ayo, La Salle adopted a defense-oriented system with emphasis on [fast breaks](/wiki/Fast_break "Fast break") and the use of [full-court press](/wiki/Full-court_press "Full-court press") which Ayo called "Mayhem".[[86]](#cite_note-87) The Green Archers finished the elimination round as the top seed with a 13–1 record with Ateneo coming in second with a 10–4 win–loss record. The only loss of the Green Archers came at the hands of their archivals, the Ateneo Blue Eagles during the second to the last game of the elimination round. Coming into Final Four both teams have a twice-to-beat advantage with La Salle defeating Adamson in just one game while Ateneo had to utilize their twice-to-beat incentives against FEU.[[87]](#cite_note-88)[[88]](#cite_note-89) After eight years, Ateneo and La Salle faced off in the Finals, with La Salle emerging as the champion of [Season 79](/wiki/UAAP_Season_79_basketball_tournaments "UAAP Season 79 basketball tournaments") after sweeping Ateneo in the Finals.[[89]](#cite_note-90)[[90]](#cite_note-91)[[91]](#cite_note-92)[[92]](#cite_note-93)

**2017–2019: Blue Eagles win three consecutive championships**

The following year, in [Season 80](/wiki/UAAP_Season_80_basketball_tournaments "UAAP Season 80 basketball tournaments"), the Ateneo Blue Eagles won their first 13 games of the elimination round. Their bid for a sweep was denied by the De La Salle Green Archers. In the Final Four matches, La Salle went on to defeat the [Adamson Soaring Falcons](/wiki/Adamson_Soaring_Falcons_basketball "Adamson Soaring Falcons basketball"), while the Blue Eagles lost the first game to the [FEU Tamaraws](/wiki/FEU_Tamaraws_basketball "FEU Tamaraws basketball"), their second loss of the season. Ateneo prevailed over FEU in the decider and faced La Salle in the championship series. The Blue Eagles took Game One, 76–70, whereas the Green Archers rallied from 21 points down to take Game 2, 92–83. In Game 3, the Blue Eagles led by as much as 10 points in order to defeat La Salle, 88–86, and retake the men's basketball championship.[[93]](#cite_note-94)[[94]](#cite_note-95)

Season 80 would eventually become the first of three consecutive championships (all against La Salle, UP and UST, respectively) for Ateneo up to [Season 82](/wiki/UAAP_Season_82_basketball_tournaments "UAAP Season 82 basketball tournaments") (the first championship round between the #1 and #4-seeded men's basketball teams, and the first 16–0 season sweep, in UAAP history), anchored by [Thirdy Ravena](/wiki/Thirdy_Ravena "Thirdy Ravena"), the first collegiate player in UAAP history to win three consecutive Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards.[[95]](#cite_note-96) As of 2025, Ateneo remains the most recent men's basketball team to win consecutive UAAP championships.

**2022: Battle of Katipunan**

The [COVID-19 pandemic](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic "COVID-19 pandemic") halted all the remaining league tournaments in 2020, and the remainder of the season, including the entire [following season](/wiki/UAAP_Season_83 "UAAP Season 83"), was cancelled on April 7 of that year.[[96]](#cite_note-97)[[97]](#cite_note-98) During the resumption of the [UAAP Season 84 in 2022](/wiki/UAAP_Season_84_men%27s_basketball_tournament "UAAP Season 84 men's basketball tournament"), however, both Ateneo and La Salle lost to the [UP Fighting Maroons](/wiki/UP_Fighting_Maroons_men%27s_basketball "UP Fighting Maroons men's basketball") in the men's basketball post-season rounds. UP swept La Salle in the eliminations before ousting them in their final game of their Final Four series.[[98]](#cite_note-99) In addition, UP ended Ateneo's UAAP record of 39-game winning streak and their bid for a second consecutive season of elimination round sweep and stepladder finals berth,[[99]](#cite_note-100)[[100]](#cite_note-101)[[101]](#cite_note-102)[[102]](#cite_note-103) before dethroning them in their do-or-die match in the championship round and denying their bid for an unprecedented second streak of four consecutive UAAP championships. As a result, this marked the first time in UAAP history that an eventual champion team has [defeated both Ateneo and La Salle](/wiki/List_of_UAAP_Final_Four_results "List of UAAP Final Four results"), as well as win multiple [overtime](/wiki/Overtime_(sports) "Overtime (sports)") games in the championship series, in the post-season rounds in men's basketball in any single season.[[103]](#cite_note-104)[[104]](#cite_note-105)[[105]](#cite_note-106)[[106]](#cite_note-107)

In [UAAP Season 85](/wiki/UAAP_Season_85_basketball_tournaments "UAAP Season 85 basketball tournaments"), La Salle ended their seven-game losing streak to Ateneo in UAAP men's basketball dating from the Season 80 championship series in the first round of the eliminations before Ateneo won their head-to-head matchup in the second round of the eliminations.[[107]](#cite_note-108)[[108]](#cite_note-109) While both Ateneo and La Salle split their respective elimination records with the semifinal-bound UP Fighting Maroons and NU Bulldogs, Ateneo defeated UP in the second round of the eliminations to clinch the top seed while gain a twice-to-beat semifinal advantage for the sixth consecutive season—the longest overall streak in the [Final Four](/wiki/UAAP_Final_Four "UAAP Final Four") era of UAAP men's basketball—after sweeping the [Adamson Soaring Falcons](/wiki/Adamson_Soaring_Falcons_basketball "Adamson Soaring Falcons basketball") due to quotient system in the eliminations.[[109]](#cite_note-110) Meanwhile, La Salle was eliminated from semifinal contention after losing to Adamson in their playoff for the fourth seed.[[110]](#cite_note-111)[[111]](#cite_note-112) UP and Ateneo eventually ousted NU and Adamson, respectively, en route to their second consecutive (and third overall) joint UAAP men's basketball championship series appearance.[[112]](#cite_note-113)[[113]](#cite_note-114) Ateneo prevailed in three games to deny the UP Fighting Maroons their bid for an unprecedented double UAAP championship streak in a single calendar year, anchored by [Ange Kouame](/wiki/Ange_Kouame "Ange Kouame"), the first naturalized and overall player in UAAP men's basketball history to win Rookie of the Year, and Season and Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards.[[114]](#cite_note-115)[[115]](#cite_note-116)

**2023–2025: La Salle–UP Finals**

In December 2022, La Salle opted not to renew the contract of [Derrick Pumaren](/wiki/Derrick_Pumaren "Derrick Pumaren") after having been the head coach of the Green Archers for UAAP Seasons 84 and 85.[[116]](#cite_note-117) In January 2023, [Topex Robinson](/wiki/Topex_Robinson "Topex Robinson") was named as the new head coach, taking over from Pumaren for [UAAP Season 86](/wiki/UAAP_Season_86_basketball_tournaments "UAAP Season 86 basketball tournaments").[[117]](#cite_note-118)[[118]](#cite_note-119)[[119]](#cite_note-120)[[120]](#cite_note-121) Ateneo won over La Salle in their first round encounter of the season.[[121]](#cite_note-122)[[122]](#cite_note-123) La Salle would then beat Ateneo to sweep the second round of the eliminations on an eight-game win streak.[[123]](#cite_note-124)[[124]](#cite_note-125) The Blue Eagles were eventually dethroned by the UP Fighting Maroons in the first game of their Final Four encounter,[[125]](#cite_note-126)[[126]](#cite_note-127) ending Ateneo's streak of UAAP Finals and podium appearances dating back from Baldwin's debut as head coach in the UAAP in 2016. Meanwhile, La Salle would make their first UAAP Finals appearance since UAAP Season 80 in 2017 after beating the NU Bulldogs, extending the all-time record for the most overall number of Finals appearances by any men's basketball team in UAAP Final Four history.[[127]](#cite_note-128)[[128]](#cite_note-129)

The Green Archers went on to win their 10th UAAP championship against the Fighting Maroons in three games during their first ever head-to-head UAAP Finals (and second overall playoffs stage) matchup.[[129]](#cite_note-130)[[130]](#cite_note-131) The third game of the finals drew a record 25,192 fans in attendance at the [Smart Araneta Coliseum](/wiki/Araneta_Coliseum "Araneta Coliseum").[[131]](#cite_note-132) [Kevin Quiambao](/wiki/Kevin_Quiambao "Kevin Quiambao") became the first local UAAP MVP since Ateneo's Ravena, and the first Green Archer to win the MVP since Ben Mbala.[[132]](#cite_note-133)[[133]](#cite_note-134) He would also be crowned the Finals MVP, becoming the first local UAAP player in the post-[COVID pandemic](/wiki/COVID_pandemic "COVID pandemic") era to have won Rookie of the Year, Season and Finals MVP awards in a single career.[[134]](#cite_note-135)[[135]](#cite_note-136) Robinson joined a group of La Salle mentors who reached the UAAP Finals in their first year as head coach and won the championship. This includes coaches [Franz Pumaren](/wiki/Franz_Pumaren "Franz Pumaren"), [Juno Sauler](/wiki/Juno_Sauler "Juno Sauler"), and [Aldin Ayo](/wiki/Aldin_Ayo "Aldin Ayo").[[136]](#cite_note-137)[[137]](#cite_note-138)

In [Season 87](/wiki/UAAP_Season_87_basketball_tournaments "UAAP Season 87 basketball tournaments"), the De La Salle Green Archers emerged as the top seed after sweeping both Ateneo Blue Eagles and second-seeded UP Fighting Maroons in the elimination rounds, while Ateneo dropped to the eighth seed and did not qualify to the men's basketball playoffs for the first time in the Coach [Tab Baldwin](/wiki/Tab_Baldwin "Tab Baldwin") era and since 2013.[[138]](#cite_note-139) La Salle and UP defeated the Adamson Soaring Falcons and UST Growling Tigers, respectively, for their second consecutive and overall UAAP Finals matchup. However, La Salle was dethroned after losing to UP in three games in the championship series in the same season.[[139]](#cite_note-140)[[140]](#cite_note-141)[[141]](#cite_note-142) The winner-take-all game between the Fighting Maroons and the Green Archers drew a record 25,248 fans inside the Smart Araneta Coliseum, resetting their joint previous record the preceding year to become the second largest in-venue attendance in any event in UAAP history after NU defeated UP and UST during the [2015](/wiki/UAAP_Season_78 "UAAP Season 78") [Cheerdance Competition](/wiki/UAAP_Cheerdance_Competition "UAAP Cheerdance Competition").[[142]](#cite_note-143)

In [Season 88](/wiki/UAAP_Season_88_basketball_tournaments "UAAP Season 88 basketball tournaments"), Ateneo and La Salle split their elimination round matchups, with Ateneo winning the first round and La Salle winning the second round. The Green Archers' win in the second round eliminated the Blue Eagles from Final Four contention. This marked the first time since UAAP Seasons 60 and 61 that the Blue Eagles missed the Final Four in two consecutive seasons.[[143]](#cite_note-144)[[144]](#cite_note-145) The UP Fighting Maroons and the De La Salle Green Archers emerged as the second and fourth seed teams respectively, heading into the Final Four.[[145]](#cite_note-146)[[146]](#cite_note-147) UP eliminated the third-seeded UST Growling Tigers in one game, while La Salle swept the top-seeded NU Bulldogs to return to the finals to face the Fighting Maroons for the third consecutive year. The De La Salle Green Archers dethroned the UP Fighting Maroons during the best-of-three series, having lost Game 2 but won Games 1 and 3 to claim their 11th UAAP championship.[[147]](#cite_note-148)[[148]](#cite_note-149) The Green Archers became the second fourth seed team to win the title after the NU Bulldogs from [UAAP Season 77](/wiki/UAAP_Season_77_basketball_tournaments "UAAP Season 77 basketball tournaments") in 2014.[[149]](#cite_note-150)[[150]](#cite_note-151) This also marked the fifth consecutive season where the [UAAP Finals series reached a do-or-die third game](/wiki/UAAP_basketball_championships "UAAP basketball championships") – the longest such streak so far in the league's Final Four history.

### Juniors' basketball rivalry

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ateneo%E2%80%93La_Salle_rivalry&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Juniors' basketball rivalry")]

The two universities are also represented in the high school level, with the [Ateneo de Manila High School](/wiki/Ateneo_de_Manila_University#Basic_education "Ateneo de Manila University") (AHS) and La Salle's junior teams. La Salle's juniors' team was represented first by DLSC High School from 1924 to 1967, followed by [La Salle Green Hills](/wiki/La_Salle_Green_Hills "La Salle Green Hills") (LSGH) from 1968 up to 1981, and then [De La Salle Santiago Zobel School](/wiki/De_La_Salle_Santiago_Zobel_School "De La Salle Santiago Zobel School") (DLSZ) from 1986 through the present. A similar rivalry, although on a much lesser scale, currently exists. When La Salle Green Hills used to be the juniors' team of the Green Archers in the NCAA, the rivalry between Ateneo and La Salle in the high school level was much stronger, considering that both the Ateneo de Manila High School and La Salle Green Hills used to be all-male schools, igniting a huge rumble in 1978. Ateneo de Manila High School became coed in 2016,[[151]](#cite_note-152) while La Salle Green Hills became coed in its senior high school program first in 2020,[[152]](#cite_note-153) and then in all levels by 2021.[[153]](#cite_note-154) However, this rivalry has since faded with AHS transferring to the UAAP in 1978 and LSGH staying in the NCAA. Still, the remnants of this rivalry live on in the UAAP with LSGH's sister school DLSZ, the juniors representative of De La Salle University in the UAAP, taking its place.

In juniors' basketball, Ateneo has 11 NCAA titles and 19 UAAP titles, for a total of 30, whereas La Salle has six NCAA titles and two UAAP titles, for eight in total. The De La Salle Greenies defeated the Ateneo Blue Eaglets in the 1939 NCAA Juniors Championship. Ateneo de Manila High School and De La Salle Santiago Zobel School met twice in the UAAP juniors' basketball finals; in [2007](/wiki/UAAP_Season_70 "UAAP Season 70") in which the Junior Archers swept the series in two games dethroning the Eaglets in the process, and in [2009](/wiki/UAAP_Season_72 "UAAP Season 72") in which the Blue Eaglets won the best-of-three series, 2–1. In addition, the Junior Archers were not able to defend their [2005 championship](/wiki/UAAP_Season_68 "UAAP Season 68") due to their suspension along with their seniors' counterparts.[[154]](#cite_note-155)

However, the admission was made months after learning about the ineligibility. The UAAP Board forfeited their 2004–05 championship title and had to return their trophy. As a result, FEU was awarded the men's basketball championship for the 2004–05 season. The Green Archers' team standings from 2003 to 2005 were revoked and La Salle was suspended in the 2006–07 season from all UAAP events. Four Ateneo wins and seven La Salle wins from the 2003 to 2005 seasons were forfeited, but this only affected the championships, moreover nullity of title does not imply a win column to the opposition.[[52]](#cite_note-DLSU_suspension_1-53)[[53]](#cite_note-DLSU_suspension_2-54)

### Overall

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ateneo%E2%80%93La_Salle_rivalry&action=edit&section=27 "Edit section: Overall")]

In terms of total collegiate and high school volleyball titles won in the NCAA and UAAP, La Salle leads with 43 championships compared to Ateneo's 15 championships. In the seniors' division, La Salle leads Ateneo 19–9. La Salle was 4-peat NCAA men's champions from Seasons 53 to 56. The Green Spikers won their most recent UAAP titles in Seasons 64 and 66. The Lady Spikers were the first NCAA women's champions in volleyball when the tournament was introduced in NCAA Season 51 (1975–76) and have 12 UAAP titles. They are thrice 3-peat UAAP women's champions (2004–2006, 2011–2013, and 2016–2018), and hold the distinction of having the [longest appearance in the UAAP Finals in the Final Four era](/wiki/UAAP_Volleyball_Championship "UAAP Volleyball Championship"), from [Season 71](/wiki/UAAP_Season_71 "UAAP Season 71") to [Season 80](/wiki/UAAP_Season_80 "UAAP Season 80") (2009–2018). La Salle is also the only women's volleyball team in UAAP history to both outright win the championship by winning all 14 elimination round games in a season ([Season 67](/wiki/UAAP_Season_67 "UAAP Season 67")), and to have advanced outright to then-best-of-five championship series with thrice-to-beat incentives by winning all 14 elimination round games in a season for at least two seasons ([Season 74](/wiki/UAAP_Season_74 "UAAP Season 74") and [Season 76](/wiki/UAAP_Season_76 "UAAP Season 76")).

Ateneo won the double (men's and women's) volleyball championship in NCAA Season 52 (1976–77), won its first UAAP volleyball championship in [Season 76](/wiki/UAAP_Season_76 "UAAP Season 76"), and, by [Season 77](/wiki/UAAP_Season_77 "UAAP Season 77") and as of 2025, remains the most recent school to win the double UAAP volleyball championship in the seniors' division. The Lady Eagles were back-to-back UAAP women's champions in Seasons 76 and 77, and won their third title in [Season 81](/wiki/UAAP_Season_81 "UAAP Season 81"). The Lady Eagles became the first volleyball team in UAAP history to finish an entire season (including the finals) without a single loss (16–0) in the [Season 77](/wiki/UAAP_Season_77 "UAAP Season 77") women's volleyball tournament. The Blue Eagles were 3-peat UAAP men's champions from Season 77 to [Season 79](/wiki/UAAP_Season_79 "UAAP Season 79") (2015–2017), the latter marking their perfect season in the men's volleyball tournament. Ateneo is the first member school in the UAAP to have scored 16–0 season win sweep records in both men's and women's divisions in collegiate volleyball.

The [Ateneo Lady Eagles](/wiki/Ateneo_Blue_Eagles_women%27s_volleyball "Ateneo Blue Eagles women's volleyball") and the [De La Salle Lady Spikers](/wiki/De_La_Salle_Lady_Spikers_volleyball "De La Salle Lady Spikers volleyball") have met in the championships of the UAAP for six consecutive (and overall) times from Seasons 74 to 79 (2012–2017). The Lady Eagles won back-to-back titles over La Salle in 2014 and 2015, while the Lady Spikers prevailed back-to-back in 2012 and 2013, and 2016 and 2017. From [UAAP Season 72](/wiki/UAAP_Season_72 "UAAP Season 72") to [UAAP Season 84](/wiki/UAAP_Season_84 "UAAP Season 84"), both Ateneo and La Salle have qualified in the postseason of women's volleyball (semifinals onwards), marking the longest joint Final Four appearance by any two UAAP volleyball teams in the league's history. Also, from [UAAP Season 71](/wiki/UAAP_Season_71 "UAAP Season 71") to [UAAP Season 85](/wiki/UAAP_Season_85 "UAAP Season 85"), either or both Ateneo and La Salle have competed in the championship series in UAAP collegiate volleyball.

In the juniors' division, La Salle has 24 championships while Ateneo has six. Ateneo did not have a girls' team in the juniors' division prior to [UAAP Season 86](/wiki/UAAP_Season_86 "UAAP Season 86"). The Blue Eaglet Spikers won championship titles in NCAA Seasons 43, 45, and 48, and were 3-peat champions from Seasons 50 to 52. The De La Salle Junior Spikers won seven championship titles under their membership stint in the NCAA which included a 4-peat championship streak along with the Green Spikers from Seasons 53 to 56. In the UAAP, they were 6-peat champions in the boys' division from Seasons 57 to 62, and have also won the title in Season 66. The Junior Lady Spikers were 5-peat champions from UAAP Seasons 57 to 61, and were 3-peat champions from Seasons 73 to 75. They also won additional titles in UAAP Seasons 65 and 81.

**UAAP Season 74 Women's Volleyball Finals**

For the first time in UAAP history, Ateneo and La Salle met each other at the [UAAP Season 74 women's volleyball finals](/wiki/UAAP_Season_74_volleyball_tournaments "UAAP Season 74 volleyball tournaments"). The De La Salle Lady Spikers became the first volleyball team ever to automatically enter the UAAP Finals with a thrice-to-beat advantage after sweeping the elimination round. On the other hand, the Ateneo Lady Eagles, consistently ranked second throughout much of the elimination round (with losses to La Salle, twice, and UST in the second round), defeated the third-seeded (and [previous season's](/wiki/UAAP_Season_73_volleyball_tournaments "UAAP Season 73 volleyball tournaments") runner-up) [UST Tigresses](/wiki/UST_Growling_Tigers "UST Growling Tigers") in the semifinals in four sets. This marks Ateneo's first entry to the UAAP volleyball finals since the school's 1978 admission into the UAAP.

Game One of the Finals was won by Ateneo in four sets, 23–25, 28–26, 25–23, 25–17, marking the first recorded Ateneo victory in any UAAP volleyball championship series while halting then-league record of 24 consecutive wins by La Salle (dating back from Season 73). La Salle went on to recover in Game Two in four sets, 23–25, 25–21, 26–24, 25–18, before sweeping Ateneo in Game Three, 25–16, 25–22, 25–13, to finish off the series in three games and win their second consecutive (and seventh overall) UAAP women's volleyball championship title. [Abigail Maraño](/wiki/Aby_Mara%C3%B1o "Aby Maraño") of La Salle was named as Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season, while then-graduating La Salle team captain [Charleen Cruz](/wiki/Cha_Cruz "Cha Cruz") is the first volleyball player in UAAP history to win multiple and consecutive Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards.[[192]](#cite_note-277)[[193]](#cite_note-278)

**UAAP Season 75 Women's Volleyball Finals**

Ateneo and La Salle faced each other once again during the [UAAP Season 75 women's volleyball finals](/wiki/UAAP_Season_75_volleyball_tournaments "UAAP Season 75 volleyball tournaments") after the De La Salle Lady Spikers defeated the [NU Lady Bulldogs](/wiki/NU_Bulldogs "NU Bulldogs") (in the latter's first ever Final Four placement in UAAP women's volleyball) and the Ateneo Lady Eagles defeated the [Adamson Lady Falcons](/wiki/Adamson_Falcons "Adamson Falcons") during the Final Four matches, both in straight sets, that were held at the [Smart Araneta Coliseum](/wiki/Smart_Araneta_Coliseum "Smart Araneta Coliseum") on February 23, 2013. The UAAP Season 75 marked the first time ever that the league's Final Four and championship volleyball matches were played at the [Smart Araneta Coliseum](/wiki/Smart_Araneta_Coliseum "Smart Araneta Coliseum") and the [Mall of Asia Arena](/wiki/Mall_of_Asia_Arena "Mall of Asia Arena").

Game One of the Finals was played before a crowd of 17,342 at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on March 2, 2013. The Lady Spikers posed a comeback win over the Lady Eagles in five sets, 20–25, 17–25, 25–22, 25–22, 15–6. La Salle eventually swept Ateneo in Game Two, 25–23, 25–20, 25–16, in front of 18,779 people at the Mall of Asia Arena, to finish the series in two games and win their eighth UAAP women's volleyball championship title (and their second three-peat championship streak). La Salle team captain [Abigail Maraño](/wiki/Aby_Mara%C3%B1o "Aby Maraño") and teammate [Victonara Galang](/wiki/Victonara_Galang "Victonara Galang") became the first pair of volleyball players in UAAP history to be named co-Most Valuable Players (MVPs) of the Season, while then-graduating La Salle player [Michele Gumabao](/wiki/Michele_Gumabao "Michele Gumabao") was named the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.[[194]](#cite_note-279)[[195]](#cite_note-280)

**UAAP Season 76 Women's Volleyball Finals**

For the third time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [UAAP Season 76 women's volleyball finals](/wiki/UAAP_Season_76_volleyball_tournaments "UAAP Season 76 volleyball tournaments"). The De La Salle Lady Spikers became the first volleyball team ever to enter the UAAP Finals with a thrice-to-beat advantage after sweeping the elimination round for a second overall season. On the other hand, the Ateneo Lady Eagles, under new head coach Anusorn "Tai" Bundit, were able to reach their third consecutive finals after winning three consecutive knockout matches against fourth-seeded Adamson Lady Falcons and then second-seeded, twice-to-beat NU Lady Bulldogs under the stepladder format.

Game One of the Finals, which was held on March 5, 2014, was won by Ateneo in four sets, 17–25, 25–23, 25–13, 25–20, marking their first win against La Salle in the entire season (and their only second win against La Salle in their entire joint UAAP women's volleyball finals appearances) while ending a still-standing league record of 30 consecutive wins by La Salle in UAAP women's volleyball history (dating back from the second game of the eliminations in Season 75). Three days later, on March 8, 2014, La Salle bounced back in Game Two and defeated Ateneo in four sets, 25–14, 25–20, 19–25, 26–24. The first two games of the Finals were held at the [Smart Araneta Coliseum](/wiki/Smart_Araneta_Coliseum "Smart Araneta Coliseum").

The venue of the remaining games of the Finals shifted to the [Mall of Asia Arena](/wiki/Mall_of_Asia_Arena "Mall of Asia Arena"). In Game Three, which was held on March 12, 2014, Ateneo defeated La Salle in five sets in front of the 18,095-strong crowd, 25–21, 25–23, 18–25, 16–25, 17–15, to force a winner-take-all title match on March 15, 2014. As a result, the UAAP Season 76 women's volleyball finals series became the league's longest volleyball championship series, and is, to date, the only one to last up to four games (in a best-of-five finals series format with a 1–0 advantage for any team). In Game Four, the Ateneo Lady Eagles swept the De La Salle Lady Spikers, 25–23, 26–24, 25–21, to deny La Salle's second overall four-peat championship bid and become the lowest-seeded volleyball team to ever win a UAAP volleyball championship title (Ateneo's maiden title) at the Mall of Asia Arena after a 21,314-strong audience.

Ateneo's team captain [Alyssa Valdez](/wiki/Alyssa_Valdez "Alyssa Valdez") became the first volleyball player in UAAP history to win both awards of the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season and of the Finals, and the first UAAP athlete to win at least four awards in a single season (including awards for the Season's Best Scorer and Best Server categories).[[196]](#cite_note-281)[[197]](#cite_note-282)

**UAAP Season 77 Women's Volleyball Finals**

For the fourth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [UAAP Season 77 women's volleyball finals](/wiki/UAAP_Season_77_volleyball_tournaments "UAAP Season 77 volleyball tournaments"). For the first time in UAAP history, the Ateneo Lady Eagles defeated the De La Salle Lady Spikers twice during the elimination rounds, and entered the finals with the thrice-to-beat advantage after amassing a 14–0 eliminations sweeps record. On the other hand, the second-seeded De La Salle Lady Spikers suffered their first defeat from a non-Ateneo team in the tournament (since UST Tigresses' shocking five-set season-opening win against DLSU in Season 75) during Game One against the third-seeded NU Lady Bulldogs in the semifinals (in straight sets), but recovered in Game Two in four sets at the expense of then La Salle's team captain Victonara Galang's post-season injury (which sidelined her from playing for Season 77 Finals).

Game One of the Finals, which was held on March 11, 2015 at the [Smart Araneta Coliseum](/wiki/Smart_Araneta_Coliseum "Smart Araneta Coliseum") in front of 18,363 fans, was won by Ateneo in straight sets, 25–18, 25–19, 25–19. Three days later, on March 14, 2015, watched by 20,705 fans at the [Mall of Asia Arena](/wiki/Mall_of_Asia_Arena "Mall of Asia Arena"), Ateneo swept La Salle again in straight sets, 25–22, 25–17, 25–23, becoming the league's first ever overall volleyball varsity team to achieve a 16–0 perfect season (eliminations round up to the championship series) record and defeated La Salle for the second consecutive season to win the UAAP Season 77 volleyball championship title. Ateneo team captain [Alyssa Valdez](/wiki/Alyssa_Valdez "Alyssa Valdez") was named back-to-back Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season, while [Amy Ahomiro](/wiki/Amy_Ahomiro "Amy Ahomiro") won the award as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.[[198]](#cite_note-283)[[199]](#cite_note-284)

**UAAP Season 78 Women's Volleyball Finals**

For the fifth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [UAAP Season 78 women's volleyball finals](/wiki/UAAP_Season_78_volleyball_tournaments "UAAP Season 78 volleyball tournaments"). During the first round of the eliminations, the eventually second-seeded DLSU Lady Spikers swept the season's top-seeded ADMU Lady Eagles in three straight sets (with La Salle dealing Ateneo's first single game loss after still-standing league record of 24 consecutive wins and since winning their maiden UAAP women's volleyball title in Season 76) to deny them a sweep of the elimination round and revert the tournament to a [Regular Final Four](/wiki/UAAP_Final_Four "UAAP Final Four") format for the first time since Season 75. In the second round, however, Ateneo recovered in a five-set comeback win to seal their top-seed position.

After the eliminations, the Ateneo Lady Eagles swept the [UP Lady Maroons](/wiki/UP_Fighting_Maroons "UP Fighting Maroons") during their comeback Final Four appearance after 13 years in three straight sets in the semifinals in a return trip to the finals for fifth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance, while the De La Salle Lady Spikers recovered from a shocking five-set loss in Game 1 of their Final Four match-up against the third-seeded [FEU Lady Tamaraws](/wiki/FEU_Tamaraws "FEU Tamaraws") to sweep their opponents in do-or-die Game 2 and book their eighth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance.

The UAAP Season 78 women's volleyball finals became the first championship series since the DLSU–FEU match-up in [Season 71](/wiki/UAAP_Season_71_volleyball_tournaments "UAAP Season 71 volleyball tournaments") to last up to three games under such tournament division (in a best-of-three finals series format). Game One of the Finals, which was held on April 23, 2016 and watched by 19,921 fans at the Smart Araneta Coliseum, was won by La Salle in straight sets, 25–22, 25–22, 25–21. Four days later, on April 27, 2016, Ateneo posed a come-from-behind win against La Salle in Game Two in five sets, 18–25, 26–28, 25–17, 25–16, 15–11, in front of the 20,541-strong crowd at the Mall of Asia Arena to force a winner-take-all match on April 30, 2016. La Salle, however, recovered in four sets, 19–25, 25–21, 25–16, 25–16 in Game Three to deny Ateneo's three-peat championship bid and win their ninth overall UAAP women's volleyball championship title (and first since Season 75) in front of a record 22,858-strong crowd at the Smart Araneta Coliseum - the largest in-venue attendance for any non-basketball or cheerdance event in UAAP history. In all of Philippine volleyball, it was only surpassed by game 2 of the [2023 Premier Volleyball League Second All-Filipino Conference](/wiki/2023_Premier_Volleyball_League_Second_All-Filipino_Conference "2023 Premier Volleyball League Second All-Filipino Conference") championship between the [Creamline Cool Smashers](/wiki/Creamline_Cool_Smashers "Creamline Cool Smashers") and [Choco Mucho Flying Titans](/wiki/Choco_Mucho_Flying_Titans "Choco Mucho Flying Titans").[[200]](#cite_note-285)

Graduating Ateneo Lady Eagles' team captain [Alyssa Valdez](/wiki/Alyssa_Valdez "Alyssa Valdez") earned her third straight award for Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season, becoming the first UAAP women's volleyball athlete to earn three consecutive MVP awards since Monica Aleta from FEU from Seasons 63 to 65, and the first volleyball athlete in UAAP history to win at least four overall Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards. Meanwhile, [Kim Kianna Dy](/wiki/Kim_Kianna_Dy "Kim Kianna Dy") of the De La Salle Lady Spikers was hailed as the Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals.[[201]](#cite_note-286)[[202]](#cite_note-287)

**UAAP Season 79 Women's Volleyball Finals**

For the sixth time, Ateneo and La Salle faced each other during [UAAP Season 79 women's volleyball finals](/wiki/UAAP_Season_79_volleyball_tournaments "UAAP Season 79 volleyball tournaments"). During the first round of eliminations, the defending champions (and eventually second-seeded) De La Salle Lady Spikers suffered a shock straight sets loss to the UP Lady Maroons but recovered in the second round of eliminations against the same team with another straight sets victory. Meanwhile, the Ateneo Lady Eagles suffered losses only to the NU Lady Bulldogs twice in the elimination rounds but swept the De La Salle Lady Spikers in the elimination rounds to secure the top seed for this season. This marks the most recent season that Ateneo has won at least a single game against La Salle in UAAP women's volleyball tournament as of 2025.

In the semifinal round, the De La Salle Lady Spikers won over the third-seeded UST Tigresses during the latter's comeback Final Four appearance after 5 years in four sets to book their ninth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance, while the Ateneo Lady Eagles also won against the fourth-seeded FEU Lady Tamaraws in four sets to book their sixth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance. This marked the longest streak of joint UAAP Finals appearances by any two women's volleyball teams in the league's history.

Game One of the Finals was held at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on May 2, 2017 in front of 13,468 fans. The De La Salle Lady Spikers recorded their first victory against Ateneo Lady Eagles during this game for this season in four sets, 21–25, 29–27, 25–22 and 25–20. Game Two of the Finals was held again at the Smart Araneta Coliseum on May 6, 2017 in front of 20,860 fans. The De La Salle Lady Spikers won against the Ateneo Lady Eagles in five sets, 19–25, 25–14, 18–25, 25–18 and 15–10, to sweep the series in two games and earn their second consecutive (and 10th overall) UAAP women's volleyball title. La Salle players [Mary Joy Baron](/wiki/Mary_Joy_Baron "Mary Joy Baron") and [Desiree Cheng](/wiki/Desiree_Cheng "Desiree Cheng") were named as Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Season and of the Finals, respectively.[[203]](#cite_note-288)[[204]](#cite_note-289)

**UAAP Seasons 80 and 81 Women's Volleyball**

Season 79 would eventually be the last of the string of six consecutive Ateneo–La Salle match-ups in the UAAP women's volleyball finals dating back from Season 74. The Lady Eagles, after losing twice to the De La Salle Lady Spikers, FEU Lady Tamaraws and NU Lady Bulldogs in the first round, and to the UP Lady Maroons in the second round of the eliminations, were booted out from finals contention in [Season 80](/wiki/UAAP_Season_80_volleyball_tournaments "UAAP Season 80 volleyball tournaments") as the third-seeded team by that season's hosting school and second-seeded team FEU Lady Tamaraws in four sets. This marked the first time that Ateneo lost in the Final Four with a twice-to-beat disadvantage since their Final Four showdown against La Salle in [Season 73](/wiki/UAAP_Season_73_volleyball_tournaments "UAAP Season 73 volleyball tournaments").

Meanwhile, the top-seeded De La Salle Lady Spikers, after losing only to both the Adamson Lady Falcons and NU Lady Bulldogs in the first round of the eliminations, swept the fourth-seeded NU Lady Bulldogs in their Final Four match-up to pose their tenth consecutive UAAP Finals appearance in 2018. La Salle would eventually sweep FEU in the finals (in the first consecutive UAAP women's volleyball finals sweep records since collegiate volleyball's shift to second semester in the UAAP annual calendar in [Season 69](/wiki/UAAP_Season_69 "UAAP Season 69")) to win their 11th UAAP women's volleyball title (and their third three-peat championship streak, the most in UAAP history) in 2018. Then-graduating La Salle player [Dawn Macandili](/wiki/Dawn_Macandili "Dawn Macandili") became the first volleyball libero in UAAP history to win the award for Most Valuable Player (MVP) of the Finals. As of 2025, La Salle remains the most recent women's volleyball team to win consecutive UAAP championships.[[205]](#cite_note-290)[[206]](#cite_note-291)

In [Season 81](/wiki/UAAP_Season_81_volleyball_tournaments "UAAP Season 81 volleyball tournaments"), however, La Salle lost back-to-back games against the UP Lady Maroons and UST Golden Tigresses in the first round of the eliminations (marking their first back-to-back elimination round losses since the forfeiture of their wins in [Season 70](/wiki/UAAP_Season_70_volleyball_tournaments "UAAP Season 70 volleyball tournaments") due to eligibility issues), and lost back-to-back games against the FEU Lady Tamaraws in the last game of the eliminations, and the second-seed playoff (and twice-to-beat semifinal incentive) to UST (marking their first back-to-back losses between the elimination rounds and the post-season playoffs since Season 77). La Salle was eventually dethroned in their Final Four match-up against UST the same year, ending their third overall bid for four straight championships and still-standing league record of decade-long appearance in the UAAP Finals.[[207]](#cite_note-292) This season marked the first time that [no green-colored school has competed in the UAAP women's volleyball finals in the 21st century](/wiki/University_Athletic_Association_of_the_Philippines#La_Salle-FEU_rivalry "University Athletic Association of the Philippines"), and the first time that the defending UAAP women's volleyball champions have been dethroned in the season outside the championship series since FEU's Final Four ousting of UST (and eventual overall title win) in Season 70.

Meanwhile, the top-seeded Ateneo Lady Eagles, after losing only to La Salle twice in the elimination rounds, won in their third consecutive year of Final Four match-up against fourth-seeded FEU (after erasing Ateneo's twice-to-beat incentive in the opening match of their semifinal showdown) to pose their return to the finals (their seventh overall) after missing the cut in the previous year. This marked the first time since Season 69 that both of the previous season's finalists were eliminated before the UAAP women's volleyball championship round. The Lady Eagles went on to win the finals against UST, 2–1, in the first ever Ateneo–UST UAAP volleyball finals showdown, to claim their third (overall) women's volleyball title (and their first since Season 77). This marked the first time that the eventual UAAP women's volleyball champions overcame a finals series game deficit to win the title since Season 76. Then-graduating team captains [Cherry Ann Rondina](/wiki/Cherry_Ann_Rondina "Cherry Ann Rondina") of UST and [Bea de Leon](/wiki/Bea_de_Leon "Bea de Leon") of Ateneo were hailed the Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards of the Season and Finals, respectively.[[208]](#cite_note-293)[[209]](#cite_note-294)

**UAAP Seasons 82 and 84 Women's Volleyball**

Ateneo's UAAP women's volleyball title defense campaign, however, was postponed due to the [COVID-19 pandemic](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic "COVID-19 pandemic") that [halted all remaining league tournaments in 2020](/wiki/UAAP_Season_82_volleyball_tournaments "UAAP Season 82 volleyball tournaments"). The first and only Ateneo–La Salle women's volleyball game which La Salle won in four sets, became the UAAP's last match to be held (and the [last major sporting event broadcast live in the Philippines](/wiki/2020_in_Philippine_television "2020 in Philippine television")) in the same year.[[210]](#cite_note-295)[[211]](#cite_note-296) The remainder of [Season 82](/wiki/UAAP_Season_82 "UAAP Season 82") was officially cancelled on April 7, 2020.[[212]](#cite_note-297)[[213]](#cite_note-298)

La Salle would later on repeat the same victory against Ateneo in the first round of the eliminations in the post-pandemic resumption of the UAAP tournaments in [2022](/wiki/UAAP_Season_84_volleyball_tournaments "UAAP Season 84 volleyball tournaments") to extend their head-to-head winning streak since their finals sweep in Season 79.[[214]](#cite_note-299)[[215]](#cite_note-300)[[216]](#cite_note-301) In the second game of the tournament, La Salle would win in five sets to sweep Ateneo in the elimination round.[[217]](#cite_note-302)[[218]](#cite_note-303)[[219]](#cite_note-304) During the eliminations, Ateneo and La Salle were swept by the NU Lady Bulldogs and split their win-loss records with the UST Golden Tigresses and Adamson Lady Falcons. La Salle would later on grab the second seed and twice-to-beat advantage in the stepladder playoffs after National University advanced outright to the UAAP Finals, while fourth-seeded Ateneo ousted Adamson and UST in consecutive games to become the lowest-seeded Final Four team in UAAP women's volleyball history to complete a podium finish after setting up the only second Ateneo–La Salle semifinals series in the same division. La Salle dethroned Ateneo via sweep in the stepladder semifinals to pose their return to the UAAP Finals, marking the first time in the [Final Four](/wiki/Final_Four "Final Four") era of UAAP women's volleyball that both preceding season's finalists were ousted from the championship round for consecutive seasons.[[220]](#cite_note-305)[[221]](#cite_note-306)

La Salle eventually lost to the NU Lady Bulldogs via series sweep as the Lady Bulldogs went on to win their first championship in 65 years.[[222]](#cite_note-307)[[223]](#cite_note-308) National University became the first non-Ateneo and non-La Salle team to complete a sweep in UAAP women's volleyball, following the season sweep records by La Salle in 2004 (Season 67, 14–0 all throughout the eliminations) and Ateneo in 2015 (Season 77, 16–0 from the eliminations to stepladder finals series). Consequently, this season marked the first time in UAAP women's volleyball history that both Ateneo and La Salle lost in all the races of Rookie of the Year, Season and Finals Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards, as NU clinched these accolades courtesy of [Mhicaela Belen](/wiki/Mhicaela_Belen "Mhicaela Belen"), the league's first collegiate volleyball player ever to sweep the Rookie of the Year, Most Valuable Player (MVP) and tournament championship awards in the same year, and team captain [Princess Anne Robles](/wiki/Princess_Anne_Robles "Princess Anne Robles").[[224]](#cite_note-309)[[225]](#cite_note-310)[[226]](#cite_note-311)

**UAAP Seasons 85 and 86 Women's Volleyball**

In [Season 85](/wiki/UAAP_Season_85_volleyball_tournaments "UAAP Season 85 volleyball tournaments"), La Salle swept all first nine games of the season to secure the top seed, including an eventual sweep of Ateneo and the defending champions NU Lady Bulldogs in the elimination rounds via quadruple 3-set wins. However, the UST Golden Tigresses defeated both Ateneo and La Salle in the second round of the eliminations to both revert the UAAP women's volleyball post-season format back to a regular Final Four setting for the first time in UAAP's post-[COVID-19 pandemic](/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic "COVID-19 pandemic") era and since Season 81, and end Ateneo's Final Four appearance streak in UAAP women's volleyball dating back from [Season 72](/wiki/UAAP_Season_72_volleyball_tournaments "UAAP Season 72 volleyball tournaments") – the school's longest in the tournament's history. This also officially ended the joint Ateneo-La Salle presence in the UAAP women's volleyball post-season rounds from the said season to [Season 84](/wiki/UAAP_Season_84_women%27s_volleyball_tournament "UAAP Season 84 women's volleyball tournament") – the longest by multiple schools simultaneously in the tournament's history.

La Salle went on to sweep the NU Lady Bulldogs in the Finals and claim their 12th UAAP women's volleyball title in their first joint back-to-back UAAP Finals appearance since the sixth consecutive (and most recent) Ateneo-La Salle matchup in the championship series in Season 79, spearheaded by [Angel Anne Canino](/wiki/Angel_Anne_Canino "Angel Anne Canino"), who became the school's first ever collegiate (and, as of 2025, the league's only second consecutive women's and most recent overall) volleyball player to win Rookie of the Year and Season Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards, and tournament championship in the same year.[[227]](#cite_note-312)[[228]](#cite_note-313)[[229]](#cite_note-314)

La Salle's ongoing head-to-head winning streak against Ateneo continued throughout the elimination rounds in [Season 86](/wiki/UAAP_Season_86_volleyball_tournaments "UAAP Season 86 volleyball tournaments"), with Ateneo missing out consecutive seasons for Final Four contention for the first time since Season 69. La Salle, however, lost to the eventual finalists UST Golden Tigresses and NU Lady Bulldogs in the elimination rounds, with UST eventually dethroning La Salle during their Final Four matchup and becoming the first team to oust La Salle from UAAP Finals contention at any given point of the season (elimination rounds or playoffs) multiple times since the debut of [Ramil de Jesus](/wiki/Ramil_de_Jesus "Ramil de Jesus") as the latter team's (currently ongoing) head coach in Season 60 in 1997. As a result, Season 86 marks the first time since Season 70 in 2008 that neither Ateneo nor La Salle have qualified to the [women's volleyball championship series in the UAAP](/wiki/UAAP_volleyball_championships "UAAP volleyball championships").[[230]](#cite_note-315)

The rivalry started to gain recognition in [UAAP Season 74](/wiki/UAAP_Season_74 "UAAP Season 74") when both teams met in the finals for the first time. Head-to-head championships between the teams have La Salle leading four championships to two. The [Ateneo Lady Eagles](/wiki/Ateneo_Blue_Eagles_women%27s_volleyball "Ateneo Blue Eagles women's volleyball") and the [De La Salle Lady Spikers](/wiki/De_La_Salle_Lady_Spikers_volleyball "De La Salle Lady Spikers volleyball") have fought in the UAAP Finals for six consecutive times from Seasons 74 to 79 (2012–2017), where the Lady Eagles won in 2014 and 2015 while the Lady Spikers won in 2012, 2013, 2016, and 2017.

## Cultural impact

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ateneo%E2%80%93La_Salle_rivalry&action=edit&section=39 "Edit section: Cultural impact")]

Due to the numerous socialites watching the games live, La Salle head coach [Franz Pumaren](/wiki/Franz_Pumaren "Franz Pumaren") mentioned that "The janitors in the Araneta Coliseum would often say if there's an Ateneo–La Salle game, once everybody's out of the Coliseum, it still smells good because of all the socialites watching."[[15]](#cite_note-NY-16) In the late 1990s, former first daughter and actress [Kris Aquino](/wiki/Kris_Aquino "Kris Aquino") would call Ateneo head coach [Joe Lipa](/wiki/Joe_Lipa "Joe Lipa") to check on the team's progress, according to [Ricky Dandan](/wiki/Ricky_Dandan "Ricky Dandan"), Lipa's former assistant coach. [Joel Banal](/wiki/Joel_Banal "Joel Banal"), Ateneo's head coach from 2002 to [2003](/wiki/UAAP_Season_66 "UAAP Season 66"), used to have nightmares about La Salle's dreaded [press](/wiki/Full-court_press "Full-court press"), and considers the 2002 championship as his greatest accomplishment, after which Ateneo alums would pay for his restaurant bills. Moreover, Ateneo alumni installed the playing floor on the [2000 NBA All-Star Game](/wiki/2000_NBA_All-Star_Game "2000 NBA All-Star Game") to the Moro Lorenzo Sports Center, while [ICTSI](/wiki/ICTSI "ICTSI") international shipping port magnate and Lasallian billionaire [Enrique Razon, Jr.](/wiki/Enrique_K._Razon "Enrique K.

During the collegiate games between both schools, televised coverage would occasionally flash famous and notable alumni from entertainment, politics, business, education, and other fields watching and cheering from the sidelines.[[271]](#cite_note-395) Former Ateneo cheerleader and [current](/wiki/14th_Congress_of_the_Philippines "14th Congress of the Philippines") [Senator](/wiki/Senate_of_the_Philippines "Senate of the Philippines") [Richard Gordon](/wiki/Richard_Gordon_(politician) "Richard Gordon (politician)") is renowned for sideline antics like jumping on the scorer's table to rile up the crowd.[[15]](#cite_note-NY-16) [Gary Valenciano](/wiki/Gary_Valenciano "Gary Valenciano") and [Ogie Alcasid](/wiki/Ogie_Alcasid "Ogie Alcasid"), two notable LSGH Kundirana and DLSU alumni, entertained the crowds during the [UAAP Season 73](/wiki/UAAP_Season_73 "UAAP Season 73") opening ceremonies hosted by DLSU for their university's 2011 centennial celebration.
