The [cuisine](/wiki/Cuisine "Cuisine") of [ancient Rome](/wiki/Ancient_Rome "Ancient Rome") changed a lot over the duration of the civilization's existence. Dietary [habits](/wiki/Habit_(psychology) "Habit (psychology)") were affected by the political changes from [kingdom](/wiki/Roman_Kingdom "Roman Kingdom") to [republic](/wiki/Roman_Republic "Roman Republic") to [empire](/wiki/Roman_Empire "Roman Empire"), and [Roman trading with foreigners](/wiki/Roman_economy#Trade_and_commodities "Roman economy") along with the empire's enormous expansion exposed Romans to many new foods, provincial culinary habits and cooking methods.

In the beginning, dietary differences between [Roman social classes](/wiki/Social_class_in_ancient_Rome "Social class in ancient Rome") were not great, but disparities developed with the empire's growth.

## Archaeology

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Roman_cuisine&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Archaeology")]

Most organic foods decay under ordinary conditions, but ashes and animal bones offer some archaeological details about the ancient Roman diet. [Phytoliths](/wiki/Phytoliths "Phytoliths") have been found at a cemetery in [Tarragona, Spain](/wiki/Tarragona,_Spain "Tarragona, Spain"). Imported figs were among the charred foods preserved when [Boudica](/wiki/Boudica "Boudica") and her army burned down a Roman shop in [Colchester](/wiki/Colchester "Colchester"). [Chickpeas](/wiki/Chickpeas "Chickpeas") and bowls of fruit are known from [Herculaneum](/wiki/Herculaneum "Herculaneum"), preserved since [Vesuvius](/wiki/Vesuvius "Vesuvius") destroyed the town in 79 AD. Remains of small fish bones, [sea urchin](/wiki/Sea_urchin "Sea urchin") spines and [mineralized plants](/wiki/Biomineralization "Biomineralization") have survived in the city's [sewers](/wiki/Sanitation_in_ancient_Rome "Sanitation in ancient Rome"); the plants [archaeologists](/wiki/Archaeology "Archaeology") have identified include [dill](/wiki/Dill "Dill"), [coriander](/wiki/Coriander "Coriander"), [flax](/wiki/Flax "Flax"), [lentil](/wiki/Lentil "Lentil"), [cabbage](/wiki/Cabbage "Cabbage"), [opium poppy](/wiki/Opium_poppy "Opium poppy") and various other [nuts](/wiki/Nut_(food) "Nut (food)"), fruits and [legumes](/wiki/Legume "Legume"), as well as a diverse variety of fish and shellfish. At [Pompeii](/wiki/Pompeii "Pompeii"), grapes, cheese, bread and [pastry](/wiki/Pastry "Pastry") were burned and buried in [peristyle](/wiki/Peristyle "Peristyle") courtyard gardens as offerings to household *[Lares](/wiki/Lares "Lares")*.[[1]](#cite_note-1)

## Meals

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Roman_cuisine&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Meals")]

Traditionally, a [breakfast](/wiki/Breakfast "Breakfast") called *ientaculum*[[2]](#cite_note-ArtmanJohnAncient-2) was served at dawn. At mid-day to early afternoon, Romans ate *[cena](/wiki/Cena "Cena")*,[[2]](#cite_note-ArtmanJohnAncient-2) the main meal of the day, and at nightfall a light supper called *vesperna*.[[3]](#cite_note-Artman,_John_page_26-3) With the increased importation of foreign foods, the *cena* grew larger in size and included a wider range of foods. Thus, it gradually shifted to the evening, while the *vesperna*[[3]](#cite_note-Artman,_John_page_26-3) was abandoned completely over the course of the years. The mid-day meal *prandium* became a light meal to hold one over until *cena*.[[2]](#cite_note-ArtmanJohnAncient-2) Among the lower classes of the Roman society, these changes were less pronounced as the traditional routines corresponded closely to the daily rhythms of manual labour.

However, among the upper classes, who normally did not engage in manual labour, it became customary to schedule all business obligations in the morning. After the *prandium*, the last responsibilities would be discharged, and a visit would be made to the [baths](/wiki/Thermae "Thermae"). Around 2 p.m.,[[4]](#cite_note-4) the *cena* would begin. This meal could last until late in the night, especially if guests were invited, and would often be followed by *comissatio*, a round of alcoholic beverages (usually [wine](/wiki/Wine "Wine")).

In the period of the kings and the early [Republic](/wiki/Roman_Republic "Roman Republic"), but also in later periods (for the working classes), the *cena* essentially consisted of a kind of [porridge](/wiki/Porridge "Porridge"), the *[puls](/wiki/Puls_(food) "Puls (food)")*.[[5]](#cite_note-Woolf2007a-5) The simplest kind would be made from [emmer](/wiki/Emmer "Emmer"), water, salt and fat. A more sophisticated variation was made with [olive oil](/wiki/Olive_oil "Olive oil"), and consumed with an accompaniment of assorted [vegetables](/wiki/Vegetable "Vegetable") when available. The wealthy commonly ate their *puls* with [eggs](/wiki/Eggs_as_food "Eggs as food"), [cheese](/wiki/Cheese "Cheese"), and [honey](/wiki/Honey "Honey") and it was also occasionally served with [meat](/wiki/Meat "Meat") or [fish](/wiki/Fish_(food) "Fish (food)").

Over the course of the Republican period, the *cena* developed into two courses: the main course and a dessert with fruit and seafood (e.g. [molluscs](/wiki/Mollusc "Mollusc"), [shrimp](/wiki/Shrimp_and_prawn_as_food "Shrimp and prawn as food")). By the end of the Republic, it was usual for the meal to be served in three parts: an appetiser (*gustatio*), main course (*primae mensae*), and dessert (*secundae mensae*).

The Roman legions' staple ration of food was wheat. In the 4th century, most legionaries ate as well as anyone in Rome. They were supplied with rations of bread and vegetables along with meats such as beef, mutton, or pork. Rations also depended on where the legions were stationed or were campaigning. Mutton was popular in Northern Gaul and Britannia, but pork was the main meat ration of the legions.[[6]](#cite_note-6)

## Foods and ingredients

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Roman_cuisine&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Foods and ingredients")]

The Roman colonies provided many foods to Rome; the city received [ham](/wiki/Ham "Ham") from [Belgium](/wiki/Gallia_Belgica "Gallia Belgica"), oysters from [Brittany](/wiki/Brittany "Brittany"), [garum](/wiki/Garum "Garum") from [Mauretania](/wiki/Mauretania "Mauretania"), wild game from [Tunisia](/wiki/History_of_Roman-era_Tunisia "History of Roman-era Tunisia"), [silphium](/wiki/Silphium_(antiquity) "Silphium (antiquity)") (laser) from [Cyrenaica](/wiki/Cyrenaica "Cyrenaica"), flowers from [Egypt](/wiki/Egypt_(Roman_province) "Egypt (Roman province)"), lettuce from [Cappadocia](/wiki/Cappadocia "Cappadocia"), and fish from [Pontus](/wiki/Pontus_(region) "Pontus (region)").[[7]](#cite_note-7)

The ancient Roman diet included many items that are staples of [modern Italian cooking](/wiki/Italian_cuisine "Italian cuisine"). [Pliny the Elder](/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder "Pliny the Elder") discussed more than 30 varieties of [olive](/wiki/Olive "Olive"), 40 kinds of [pear](/wiki/Pear "Pear"), [figs](/wiki/Ficus "Ficus") (native and imported from Africa and the eastern provinces), and a wide variety of [vegetables](/wiki/Vegetable "Vegetable").[[a]](#cite_note-9)[[9]](#cite_note-10) Some of these vegetables are no longer present in the modern world, while others have undergone significant changes. [Carrots](/wiki/Carrot "Carrot") of different colours were consumed, but not in orange.[[10]](#cite_note-11) Many kinds of vegetables were cultivated and consumed.[[11]](#cite_note-PatrickFaas-12) These included celery, garlic, some flower bulbs, [cabbage](/wiki/Cabbage "Cabbage") and other [brassicas](/wiki/Brassica "Brassica") (such as [kale](/wiki/Kale "Kale") and [broccoli](/wiki/Broccoli "Broccoli")), [lettuce](/wiki/Lettuce "Lettuce"), [endive](/wiki/Endive "Endive"), [onion](/wiki/Onion "Onion"), [leek](/wiki/Leek "Leek"), [asparagus](/wiki/Asparagus "Asparagus"), [radishes](/wiki/Radish "Radish"), [turnips](/wiki/Turnip "Turnip"), [parsnips](/wiki/Parsnip "Parsnip"), [carrots](/wiki/Carrot "Carrot"), [beets](/wiki/Beet "Beet"), green peas, chard, field greens, [cardoons](/wiki/Cardoon "Cardoon"), olives, and [cucumber](/wiki/Cucumber "Cucumber").[[11]](#cite_note-PatrickFaas-12) Some vegetables were illustrated in [reliefs](/wiki/Relief "Relief").[[12]](#cite_note-PatrickFaas_a-13)

However, some foods considered characteristic of modern Italian cuisine were not used.[[13]](#cite_note-PhyllisPray-14) In particular, [spinach](/wiki/Spinach "Spinach") and [eggplant](/wiki/Eggplant "Eggplant") (aubergine) were introduced later from the [Arab world](/wiki/Arab_world "Arab world"), and [tomatoes](/wiki/Tomato "Tomato"), [potatoes](/wiki/Potato "Potato"), [capsicum](/wiki/Capsicum "Capsicum") peppers, [maize](/wiki/Maize "Maize") (the modern source of [polenta](/wiki/Polenta "Polenta"))[[12]](#cite_note-PatrickFaas_a-13) and beans of the Phaseolus genus [Phaseolus vulgaris](/wiki/Phaseolus_vulgaris "Phaseolus vulgaris") (green - French and runner, lima, kidney)[[14]](#cite_note-15)[*[circular reference](/wiki/Wikipedia:Verifiability#Wikipedia_and_sources_that_mirror_or_use_it "Wikipedia:Verifiability")*] only appeared in Europe following the discovery of the [New World](/wiki/New_World "New World") and the [Columbian Exchange](/wiki/Columbian_Exchange "Columbian Exchange").[[13]](#cite_note-PhyllisPray-14) The Romans knew of rice, but it was very rarely available to them. There were also few [citrus](/wiki/Citrus "Citrus") fruits.[[13]](#cite_note-PhyllisPray-14) Lemons were known in Italy from the second century AD but were not widely cultivated.[[15]](#cite_note-16)

### Breads and grains

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Roman_cuisine&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Breads and grains")]

From 123 BC, a ration of unmilled wheat (as much as 33 kg), known as the *frumentatio*, was distributed to as many as 200,000 people every month by the Roman state.[[16]](#cite_note-:0-17) There was originally a charge for this but from 58 BC this charge was abolished by the plebeian tribune [Publius Clodius Pulcher](/wiki/Publius_Clodius_Pulcher "Publius Clodius Pulcher"). Individuals had to be citizens and domiciled in Rome to receive the *frumentatio*.[[16]](#cite_note-:0-17)

Originally flat, round loaves made of [emmer](/wiki/Emmer "Emmer") (a species of wheat) with a bit of [salt](/wiki/Edible_salt "Edible salt") were eaten; among the upper classes, [eggs](/wiki/Egg_(food) "Egg (food)"), [cheese](/wiki/Cheese "Cheese"), and [honey](/wiki/Honey "Honey"), along with [milk](/wiki/Milk "Milk") and [fruit](/wiki/Fruit "Fruit") were also consumed. In the [Imperial](/wiki/Imperial_Rome "Imperial Rome") period, around 1 AD, bread made of [wheat](/wiki/Wheat "Wheat") was introduced; with time, more and more wheaten foods began to replace emmer loaves. There were many kinds of bread of differing quality. Typically white bread was baked for the elite, with darker bread baked for the middle class, and the darkest bread for the poor peasants.[[17]](#cite_note-18) The bread was sometimes dipped in [wine](/wiki/Wine "Wine") and eaten with olives, cheese, and grapes. At the time of [the destruction of Pompeii in AD 79](/wiki/Eruption_of_Mount_Vesuvius_in_79 "Eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79"), there were at least 33 bakeries in that city.[[18]](#cite_note-19) Roman chefs made sweet buns flavored with blackcurrants and cheese cakes made with flour, honey, eggs, ricotta-like cheese and poppy seed. Sweet wine cakes were made with honey, reduced red wine and cinnamon. Fruit tarts were popular with the upper class, but the lower classes couldn't afford to personally make them or purchase them from markets and vendors.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]

*[Juscellum](/wiki/Juscellum "Juscellum")* was a broth with grated bread, eggs, sage and saffron, described in *[Apicius](/wiki/Apicius "Apicius")*, a Roman recipe book of the late 4th or early 5th century.[[19]](#cite_note-Way_1843_p._268-20)

### Meat

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Roman_cuisine&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Meat")]

Butcher's meat was an uncommon luxury. The most popular meat was [pork](/wiki/Pork "Pork"), especially [sausages](/wiki/Sausage "Sausage").[[20]](#cite_note-MaguelonneToussaintSamat-21) [Beef](/wiki/Beef "Beef") was uncommon in ancient Rome, being more common in [ancient Greece](/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece")—it is not mentioned by [Juvenal](/wiki/Juvenal "Juvenal") or [Horace](/wiki/Horace "Horace").[[20]](#cite_note-MaguelonneToussaintSamat-21) [Seafood](/wiki/Seafood "Seafood"), [game](/wiki/Game_(food) "Game (food)"), and [poultry](/wiki/Poultry "Poultry"), including ducks and geese, were more common. For instance, on his [triumph](/wiki/Roman_triumph "Roman triumph"), Caesar gave a public feast to 260,000 humiliores (poorer people) which featured all three of these foods, but no butcher's meat.[[20]](#cite_note-MaguelonneToussaintSamat-21) John E. Stambaugh writes that meat "was scarce except at sacrifices and the dinner parties of the rich".[[21]](#cite_note-John-22) Cows were prized for their milk; bulls as plough and draft [animals](/wiki/Animals_in_ancient_Greece_and_Rome "Animals in ancient Greece and Rome"). Meat of working animals was tough and unappetizing. Veal was eaten occasionally. Apicius gives only four recipes for beef but the same recipes call for lamb or pork as options. There is only one recipe for beef stew and another for veal scallopini.[[22]](#cite_note-23)

[Dormice](/wiki/Edible_dormouse "Edible dormouse") were eaten and considered a [delicacy](/wiki/Delicacy "Delicacy").[[23]](#cite_note-24) It was a status symbol among wealthy Romans, and some even had dormice weighed in front of dinner guests.[[24]](#cite_note-25) A [sumptuary law](/wiki/Sumptuary_law "Sumptuary law") enacted under [Marcus Aemilius Scaurus](/wiki/Marcus_Aemilius_Scaurus_(consul_115_BC) "Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (consul 115 BC)") forbade the eating of dormice, but failed to stop the practice.[[25]](#cite_note-26)

### Fish and seafood

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Roman_cuisine&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Fish and seafood")]

Fish was more common than meat.[[21]](#cite_note-John-22) [Aquaculture](/wiki/Aquaculture "Aquaculture") was sophisticated, with large-scale industries devoted to [oyster farming](/wiki/Oyster_farming "Oyster farming").[[21]](#cite_note-John-22) The Romans also engaged in [snail farming](/wiki/Heliciculture "Heliciculture") and oak grub farming.[[21]](#cite_note-John-22) Some fish were greatly esteemed and fetched high prices, such as mullet raised in the fishery at [Cosa](/wiki/Cosa "Cosa"), and "elaborate means were invented to assure its freshness".[[21]](#cite_note-John-22)

### Fruit

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Roman_cuisine&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Fruit")]

Fruit was eaten fresh when in season, and [dried](/wiki/Dried_fruit "Dried fruit") or preserved over winter. Popular fruits included [apples](/wiki/Apple "Apple"), [pears](/wiki/Pear "Pear"), [figs](/wiki/Common_fig "Common fig"), [grapes](/wiki/Grape "Grape"), [quinces](/wiki/Quince "Quince"), [citron](/wiki/Citron "Citron"), [strawberries](/wiki/Strawberry "Strawberry"), [blackberries](/wiki/Blackberry "Blackberry"), [elderberries](/wiki/Elderberries "Elderberries"), [currants](/wiki/Ribes "Ribes"), [damson plums](/wiki/Damson "Damson"), [dates](/wiki/Date_(fruit) "Date (fruit)"), [melons](/wiki/Melon "Melon"), [rose hips](/wiki/Rose_hip "Rose hip") and [pomegranates](/wiki/Pomegranate "Pomegranate").[[21]](#cite_note-John-22) Less common fruits were the more exotic [azeroles](/wiki/Azeroles "Azeroles") and [medlars](/wiki/Medlar "Medlar"). [Cherries](/wiki/Cherry "Cherry") and [apricots](/wiki/Apricot "Apricot"), both introduced in the 1st century BC, were popular. Peaches were introduced in the 1st century AD from Persia. [Oranges](/wiki/Orange_(fruit) "Orange (fruit)") and [lemons](/wiki/Lemon "Lemon") were known but used more for medicinal purposes than in cookery.[[21]](#cite_note-John-22) Although known to the ancient Romans, lemons were not cultivated in Italy until the [Principate](/wiki/Principate "Principate").[[21]](#cite_note-John-22)[[26]](#cite_note-27) At least 35 [cultivars](/wiki/Cultivar "Cultivar") of pear were grown in Rome, along with three types of apples. Cato described pear culture methods similar to modern techniques.[[27]](#cite_note-28) There are recipes for pear and peach creams and milk puddings flavored with honey, pepper and a little [garum](/wiki/Garum "Garum").

[Columella](/wiki/Columella "Columella") offers advice on the preservation of figs by crushing them into a paste with anise, fennel seed, cumin and toasted sesame to be wrapped in fig leaves.[[28]](#cite_note-29)

### Vegetables

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Roman_cuisine&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Vegetables")]

While the precursors of [Brussels sprouts](/wiki/Brussels_sprout "Brussels sprout"), [artichokes](/wiki/Artichoke "Artichoke"), [peas](/wiki/Peas "Peas"), [rutabaga](/wiki/Rutabaga "Rutabaga"), and possibly [cauliflower](/wiki/Cauliflower "Cauliflower") probably existed in Roman times, the modern cultivated forms we think of were not developed until the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance times. Cabbage was eaten both raw (sometimes dipped in vinegar) and cooked.[[12]](#cite_note-PatrickFaas_a-13) [Cato](/wiki/Cato_the_Elder "Cato the Elder") greatly esteemed cabbage, believing it to be good for the digestion, and also believed that if a sick person ate a great deal of cabbage and bathed in his own [urine](/wiki/Urine "Urine"), he would recover.[[29]](#cite_note-30)

### Legumes

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Roman_cuisine&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Legumes")]

[Legumes](/wiki/Legumes "Legumes") were limited to [dried peas](/wiki/Split_peas "Split peas"), [fava beans (broad beans)](/wiki/Vicia_faba "Vicia faba"), [chickpeas](/wiki/Chickpea "Chickpea"), [lentils](/wiki/Lentil "Lentil"), and [lupins](/wiki/Lupin_bean "Lupin bean"). The Romans knew several varieties of [chickpea](/wiki/Chickpea "Chickpea"), such as venus, ram, and punic. They were either cooked down into a broth or roasted as a snack. The Roman cookbook *[Apicius](/wiki/Apicius "Apicius")* gives several recipes for chickpeas.[[30]](#cite_note-31)

### Nuts

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Roman_cuisine&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Nuts")]

The ancient Romans ate [walnuts](/wiki/Walnuts "Walnuts"), [almonds](/wiki/Almonds "Almonds"), [pistachios](/wiki/Pistachios "Pistachios"), [chestnuts](/wiki/Chestnuts "Chestnuts"), [hazelnuts (filberts)](/wiki/Hazelnut "Hazelnut"), [pine nuts](/wiki/Pine_nuts "Pine nuts"), and [sesame](/wiki/Sesame "Sesame") seeds, which they sometimes pulverized to thicken spiced, sweet wine sauces for roast meat and fowl to serve on the side or over the meat as a glaze. Nuts were also used in savoury pesto-like sauces for cold cuts. Nuts were used in pastries, tarts and puddings sweetened with honey.

### Dairy

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Roman_cuisine&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Dairy")]

[Cheese](/wiki/Cheese "Cheese") was eaten and its manufacture was well-established by the Roman Empire period.[[31]](#cite_note-Fox-32) It was part of the standard rations for Roman soldiers and was popular among civilians as well. The Emperor [Diocletian](/wiki/Diocletian "Diocletian") (284–305 CE) fixed [maximum prices](/wiki/Edict_on_Maximum_Prices "Edict on Maximum Prices") for cheese.[[31]](#cite_note-Fox-32) The manufacture of cheese and its quality and culinary uses are mentioned by a number of Roman authors: [Pliny the Elder](/wiki/Pliny_the_Elder "Pliny the Elder") described cheese's dietary and medicinal uses in Book 28 of *[Historia Naturalis](/wiki/Natural_History_(Pliny) "Natural History (Pliny)")*, and [Varro](/wiki/Varro "Varro") in *[De Agricultura](/wiki/De_Agricultura "De Agricultura")* described the Roman cheesemaking season (spring and summer) and compared soft, new cheeses with drier, aged cheeses. The most extensive description of Roman cheese-making comes from [Columella](/wiki/Columella "Columella"), from his treatise on [Roman agriculture](/wiki/Roman_agriculture "Roman agriculture"), *[De Re Rustica](/wiki/Columella#De_Re_Rustica "Columella")*.[[32]](#cite_note-33)

### Condiments

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Roman_cuisine&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Condiments")]

[Garum](/wiki/Garum "Garum") was the distinctive fish sauce of ancient Rome.[[33]](#cite_note-HarlanWalker-34) It was used as a [seasoning](/wiki/Seasoning "Seasoning"), in place of salt; as a table [condiment](/wiki/Condiment "Condiment"); and as a [sauce](/wiki/Sauce "Sauce"). There were four major fish sauce types: *garum*, *liquamen*, *muria*, and *allec*.[[33]](#cite_note-HarlanWalker-34) It was made in different qualities, from fish such as [tuna](/wiki/Tuna "Tuna"), [mullet](/wiki/Mullet_(fish) "Mullet (fish)"), and [sea bass](/wiki/European_seabass "European seabass").[[33]](#cite_note-HarlanWalker-34) It could be flavored, for example mixed with wine, or diluted with water (*hydrogarum*), a form popular among Roman soldiers, although the emperor [Elagabalus](/wiki/Elagabalus "Elagabalus") asserted that he was the first to serve it at public [banquets](/wiki/Banquet "Banquet") in Rome.[[33]](#cite_note-HarlanWalker-34) The most costly garum was *garum sociorum*, made from [mackerel](/wiki/Mackerel "Mackerel") (*scomber*) at the [New Carthage](/wiki/Cartagena,_Spain "Cartagena, Spain") fisheries in Spain, and widely traded.[[33]](#cite_note-HarlanWalker-34) Pliny wrote in his *[Natural History](/wiki/Natural_History_(Pliny) "Natural History (Pliny)")* that two [congii](/wiki/Congius "Congius") (7 litres) of this sauce cost 1,000 [sesterces](/wiki/Sestertius "Sestertius").[[34]](#cite_note-HarlanWalker_a-35) One thousand sesterces in the Early Empire was equal to 110 g of gold.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]

## Cooking

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Roman_cuisine&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Cooking")]

One of many modes of cooking in ancient Rome was the *focus*, a [hearth](/wiki/Hearth "Hearth") that was placed in front of the [lararium](/wiki/Lararium "Lararium"), the household altar which contained small sculptures of the [household deity](/wiki/Household_deity "Household deity") (the *[lares](/wiki/Lares "Lares")*, or guardian ancestor-spirits, and the *[penates](/wiki/Di_Penates "Di Penates")*, who were believed to protect the *floor*, the larder).[[36]](#cite_note-37) In homes where the *lararium* was built into the wall, the *focus* was sometimes built of raised brick into four sides, constructed against a [baseboard](/wiki/Baseboard "Baseboard") on which a fire was lit. More common was a *focus* that was rectangular and portable, consisting simply of a moveable hearth with stone or [bronze](/wiki/Bronze "Bronze") feet.[[37]](#cite_note-Faas-38) After the development of separate kitchens, the *focus* began to be used only for religious offerings and for warmth, rather than for cooking.[[37]](#cite_note-Faas-38)

Portable stoves and ovens were used by the Romans, and some had water pots and [grills](/wiki/Grilling "Grilling") laid onto them. At [Pompeii](/wiki/Pompeii "Pompeii"), most houses had separate kitchens, most fairly small, but a few large; the [Villa of the Mysteries](/wiki/Villa_of_the_Mysteries "Villa of the Mysteries") covers a nine-by-twelve meter area.[[38]](#cite_note-Faas_a-39) A number of kitchens at Pompeii had no roofs, resembling [courtyards](/wiki/Courtyard "Courtyard") more than ordinary rooms; this allowed smoke to ventilate.[[38]](#cite_note-Faas_a-39) Kitchens that did have roofs must have been extremely smokey, since the only ventilation would come from high windows or holes in the ceiling; while the Romans built [chimneys](/wiki/Chimney "Chimney") for their bakeries and smithies, they were unknown in private dwellings until about the 12th century A.D, well after the collapse of Roman civilization.[[39]](#cite_note-40)[[40]](#cite_note-41)

Many Roman kitchens had an oven (*furnus* or *fornax*), and some (such as the kitchen of the Villa of the Mysteries) had two.[[41]](#cite_note-Faas_b-42) A square or dome-shaped construction of brick or stone, these ovens had a flat floor, often of [granite](/wiki/Granite "Granite") and sometimes [lava](/wiki/Lava "Lava"), which were filled with dry twigs and then lit.[[41]](#cite_note-Faas_b-42) On the walls of kitchens were hooks and chains for hanging cooking equipment, including various pots and pans, [knives](/wiki/Knife "Knife"), meat [forks](/wiki/Fork "Fork"), [sieves](/wiki/Sieve "Sieve"), [graters](/wiki/Grater "Grater"), [spits](/wiki/Rotisserie "Rotisserie"), [tongs](/wiki/Tongs "Tongs"), [cheese-slicers](/wiki/Cheese-slicer "Cheese-slicer"), [nutcrackers](/wiki/Nutcracker "Nutcracker"), [jugs](/wiki/Jug_(container) "Jug (container)") for measuring, and [pâté](/wiki/P%C3%A2t%C3%A9 "Pâté") moulds.[[41]](#cite_note-Faas_b-42)

## Alcoholic drinks

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Roman_cuisine&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Alcoholic drinks")]

[In Ancient Rome, wine](/wiki/Ancient_Rome_and_wine "Ancient Rome and wine") was normally mixed with water immediately before drinking, since the fermentation was not controlled and the [alcohol concentration](/wiki/Proof_(alcohol) "Proof (alcohol)") was high. Wine was sometimes adjusted and "improved" by its makers: instructions survive for making [white wine](/wiki/White_wine "White wine") from [red](/wiki/Red_wine "Red wine") and vice versa, as well as for rescuing wine that is turning to [vinegar](/wiki/Vinegar "Vinegar").[[42]](#cite_note-Erdoes_1981_88-43) Those instructions as well as detailed descriptions of Roman viticulture date back to 160 BC in the oldest surviving text written in Latin prose.[[43]](#cite_note-44)

Wine was also variously flavored. For example, there was *[passum](/wiki/Passum "Passum")*, a strong and sweet raisin wine, for which the earliest known recipe is of [Carthaginian](/wiki/Carthage "Carthage") origin; *[mulsum](/wiki/Mead#List_of_mead_variants "Mead")*, a freshly made mixture of wine and honey (called a pyment today); and *[conditum](/wiki/Conditum "Conditum")*, a mixture of wine, honey and spices made in advance and matured. One specific recipe, [Conditum Paradoxum](/wiki/Conditum_Paradoxum "Conditum Paradoxum"), is for a mixture of wine, honey, [pepper](/wiki/Black_pepper "Black pepper"), [laurel](/wiki/Bay_laurel "Bay laurel"), [dates](/wiki/Date_(fruit) "Date (fruit)"), [mastic](/wiki/Mastic_(plant_resin) "Mastic (plant resin)"), and [saffron](/wiki/Saffron "Saffron"), cooked and stored for later use. Another recipe called for the addition of seawater, [pitch](/wiki/Pitch_(resin) "Pitch (resin)") and [rosin](/wiki/Rosin "Rosin") to the wine. A Greek traveler reported that the beverage was apparently an acquired taste.[[42]](#cite_note-Erdoes_1981_88-43) Sour wine mixed with water and herbs (*[posca](/wiki/Posca "Posca")*) was a popular drink for the lower classes and a staple part of the Roman soldier's ration.[[44]](#cite_note-45)

[Beer](/wiki/Beer "Beer") (*cerevisia*) was known but considered vulgar, and was associated with [barbarians](/wiki/Barbarian "Barbarian").[[45]](#cite_note-46)[[46]](#cite_note-47)

## Desserts

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Ancient_Roman_cuisine&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Desserts")]

While lacking necessary ingredients commonly used in the modern era for sweets such as refined [sugar](/wiki/Sugar "Sugar") or properly churned [butter](/wiki/Butter "Butter"), ancient Rome had desserts to serve after they had completed their meals served with [wine](/wiki/Wine "Wine").[[42]](#cite_note-Erdoes_1981_88-43) The most renowned were large platters of various fruits picked fresh; some of the more exotic fruits that were not able to grow in Rome were even shipped in from distant continents for the wealthy. Due to the lack of a [sweetener](/wiki/Sugar_substitute "Sugar substitute") such as sugar there was always a desire for the sweetest fruits that were available. Spira was a type of sweet pastry that was readily available during this time, made with a thin, cake-like crust sometimes containing fruit. Enkythoi is a common type of [Greek](/wiki/Ancient_Greece "Ancient Greece") pastry that was popular in Rome. It was softer, like a modern [sponge cake](/wiki/Sponge_cake "Sponge cake").
