The **2nd Foreign Infantry Regiment** ([French](/wiki/French_language "French language"): *2e Régiment Étranger d'Infanterie, 2e REI*) is an [infantry](/wiki/Infantry "Infantry") regiment of the [Foreign Legion](/wiki/French_Foreign_Legion "French Foreign Legion") in the [French Army](/wiki/French_Army "French Army").[[1]](#cite_note-1) The regiment is one of two mechanized infantry regiments of the [6th Light Armoured Brigade](/wiki/6th_Light_Armoured_Brigade_(France) "6th Light Armoured Brigade (France)").[[2]](#cite_note-2)[[3]](#cite_note-3)

## History

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2nd_Foreign_Infantry_Regiment_(France)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

Under the first restoration, the Bourbons only retained the Swiss, in souvenir to their loyal service rendered to France during four centuries, and with them also, four foreign regiments out of which one colonial, formed of [Spanish](/wiki/Spaniards "Spaniards") and [Portuguese](/wiki/Portuguese_people "Portuguese people"). The eight reorganized foreign regiments by Napoleon at the hundred days formed in 1815 the [Royal Foreign Legion](/wiki/Origins_of_the_French_Foreign_Legion "Origins of the French Foreign Legion") ([French](/wiki/French_language "French language"): *« Légion Royale Etrangère »*), which became the [Hohenlohe Legion](/wiki/Origins_of_the_French_Foreign_Legion "Origins of the French Foreign Legion") ([French](/wiki/French_language "French language"): *« La Légion de Hohenlohe »*), then in 1821 the [Hohenlohe Regiment](/wiki/Hohenlohe_Regiment "Hohenlohe Regiment"). Licensed in 1830, the latter contributed to form the Twenty First Light, then the French Foreign Legion ([French](/wiki/French_language "French language"): *La Légion Étrangère*). The Swiss regiments of the restoration disappeared in 1830, nevertheless, the Swiss joined the French Army again from 1855 to 1859 under the successive denomination of [2nd Foreign Legion](/wiki/2nd_Foreign_Legion_(2LE) "2nd Foreign Legion (2LE)") ([French](/wiki/French_language "French language"): *« La Deuxième Légion Etrangère »*) and 1st Foreign Regiment ([French](/wiki/French_language "French language"): *1er Régiment Etranger*).

### Foreign Legion since 1831

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2nd_Foreign_Infantry_Regiment_(France)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Foreign Legion since 1831")]

On March 10, 1831; the [Foreign Legion](/wiki/French_Foreign_Legion "French Foreign Legion") was created.[[7]](#cite_note-2rei.legion-etrangere.com-7)

On April 1, 1841, the Legion was split in two formations. The 2nd Regiment was organized at Bône, on April 13, 1841, provisionary at two battalions of the [1st Foreign Regiment](/wiki/1st_Foreign_Regiment "1st Foreign Regiment"); the 4th battalion was sent to Algiers and the 5th battalion was garrisoned at Bône. The regiment consisted, just like the other [Line infantry](/wiki/Line_infantry "Line infantry") regiments of the époque, a formation of 3,000 men. The 3rd battalion was formed in the following month of May.

The regiment was quartered at [Constantine](/wiki/Constantine,_Algeria "Constantine, Algeria") in Algeria, with garrisons held at Bône, Bougie, and Djidjelli. Colonel Senilhes was the first regimental commander. The first regimental flag was received in 1848 by colonel [Jean-Luc Carbuccia](/wiki/Jean-Luc_Carbuccia "Jean-Luc Carbuccia").

In 1854, [Napoleon III](/wiki/Napoleon_III "Napoleon III") decided to create a 2nd Legion, composed uniquely of Swiss. However, with a reduced form of recruitment, the two units, which were engaged in [Crimea](/wiki/Crimean_War "Crimean War"), were dismissed at the end of the conflict and regrouped to form the 2nd Foreign Regiment, which re-departed to Algeria in 1856.

On January 1, 1862, the two [foreign regiments](/wiki/List_of_French_Foreign_Legion_units "List of French Foreign Legion units") merged under the title of the Foreign Regiment.

As part of a reorganisation of the [Armee d'Afrique](/wiki/Armee_d%27Afrique "Armee d'Afrique"), the regiment was retitled the Foreign Legion (« Légion étrangère ») on March 13, 1875. It numbered 3018 men. On January 1, 1885, the 2nd Foreign Regiment was reformed. The 1st and 2nd [battalion](/wiki/Battalion "Battalion") remained in Algeria. The 3rd battalion was assigned to [Tonkin](/wiki/Tonkin "Tonkin") and the 4th battalion was sent to [Formosa](/wiki/Formosa "Formosa") in 1884, then returned to [Tonkin](/wiki/Tonkin "Tonkin").

#### Pacification of Algeria

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=2nd_Foreign_Infantry_Regiment_(France)&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Pacification of Algeria")]

From 1841 to 1907 legionnaires from the 2nd Regiment were deployed in Algeria.
In the early twentieth century, France faced numerous incidents, attacks and looting by uncontrolled armed groups, in the newly occupied areas in the south of Oran (Algeria). Under the command of General Lyautey, the [French Army](/wiki/French_Army "French Army")'s mission was to protect these areas newly seized in the west of Algeria, near the poorly defined Moroccan boundaries.

On 17 August 1903, the first battle of the South-Oranese campaign took place in Taghit, where Foreign legionnaires were assailed by a contingent of more than 1,000 well-equipped Berbers. For 3 days, the legionnaires repelled repeated attacks of an enemy more than 10 times higher in number, and inflicted huge losses on the attackers, forcing them finally into a hasty retreat.

A few months after the Battle of Taghit, 148 legionnaires of the 22nd mounted company, from the 2ème REI, commanded by Captain Vauchez and Lieutenant Selchauhansen, 20 [spahis](/wiki/Spahi "Spahi") and two Mokhaznis were escorting a supply convoy, when they were ambushed at 9:30 am on 2 September by 3,000 Moroccans marauders. The half-company had halted to eat, no sentries had been posted and only a few cavalry pickets had been placed.

The first volleys wounded or killed half of the detachment. Both officers and most of the non-commissioned officers were killed in the first stage of the fight. At 10:30 am, Quartermaster Sergeant (sergent-fourrier) Tisserand, who commanded the survivors, sent two spahi cavalrymen to Taghit for reinforcements. They immediately left.

About forty survivors of the French force gathered on a nearby hill and under a scorching sun, on hot sand and without water, fought off the enemy for more than eight hours. Near the end of the battle, Tisserand, wounded, gave over command to Corporal Detz; the highest-ranked man still able. At 5 pm, they were relieved by Captain de Sulbielle, who rode from Taghit with his Spahis. At the sight of the approaching French cavalry, the Moroccans retreated in small groups.

In November 1908; the Marching Regiment of the 2nd Foreign Regiment (**R.M.2èmeR.E**) was dissolved .[[7]](#cite_note-2rei.legion-etrangere.com-7)

In September 1915, the 2nd Marching Regiment of the 2nd Foreign Regiment was dissolved and the components were merged with the [2nd Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment](/wiki/2nd_Marching_Regiment_of_the_1st_Foreign_Regiment "2nd Marching Regiment of the 1st Foreign Regiment") to form the [Marching Regiment of the Foreign Legion](/wiki/Marching_Regiment_of_the_Foreign_Legion "Marching Regiment of the Foreign Legion") (**R.M.L.E**) created November 11, 1915.[[7]](#cite_note-2rei.legion-etrangere.com-7) During the [interwar period](/wiki/Interwar_period "Interwar period"), combat in Morocco persevered from 1919 to 1934 and the regiment received 7 citations at the orders of the armed forces.[[7]](#cite_note-2rei.legion-etrangere.com-7)
