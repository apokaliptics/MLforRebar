Jeeva ([Sharan](/wiki/Sharan_(actor) "Sharan (actor)")) must correct the mistakes understood about his best friend Raghu by his villagers in childhood after his death.

Then he goes to his friend's village where two village heads are enemies. When he enters he sees Raghu's sister and her boyfriend are just to be killed by the head because he is from another village. He manages to save them by marrying them and separating them in the eyes of the head. He says that he is Jeeva and a fan of the head. He lies to Raghu's mother and two sisters that he is Raghu.

He then goes to another village in the form of a director. There he falls in love with the head's daughter Geeta ([Shruti Hariharan](/wiki/Shruti_Hariharan "Shruti Hariharan")), who later reciprocates it after knowing his good character. But the twist in the tale comes when his village's head's sister Smita ([Shuba Punja](/wiki/Shuba_Punja "Shuba Punja")) tells that she loves him. Later Geeta's father learns his mistake. Jeeva violently beats up Smita's brother and gives him a chance to change which he does. The film ends with Raghu's sister's marriage. The pandit asks about Jeeva's marriage which again creates a rift which Jeeva resolves. Jeeva asks the god Maruti which he advices to choose himself.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]

Actor Sharan was roped in to play the main role while Shruthi Hariharan was selected to play the opposite lead role. Shubha Poonja was cast in the second lead role.[[3]](#cite_note-3) The principal photography started in August 2015. The first schedule of the shooting was held at [Belgaum](/wiki/Belgaum "Belgaum").[[4]](#cite_note-4) For some of the action scenes, Sharan underwent rigorous workouts and developed six packs.[[5]](#cite_note-5) The director revealed that the story starts as a period drama and drifts towards the present time.[[6]](#cite_note-6)
