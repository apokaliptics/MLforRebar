British-bred Thoroughbred racehorse (1806–1813)

**Wizard** (1806 – 30 June 1813) was a [British](/wiki/Great_Britain "Great Britain") [Thoroughbred](/wiki/Thoroughbred "Thoroughbred") [racehorse](/wiki/Horse_racing "Horse racing"). He won seven of his ten races, with all his wins coming at [Newmarket](/wiki/Newmarket_Racecourse "Newmarket Racecourse"). In 1809 he won the [2000 Guineas Stakes](/wiki/2,000_Guineas_Stakes "2,000 Guineas Stakes"), before finishing second in the [Derby Stakes](/wiki/Epsom_Derby "Epsom Derby"). The following year he won a [match race](/wiki/Match_race "Match race") against his Derby conqueror [Pope](/wiki/Pope_(horse) "Pope (horse)"). Throughout his racing career he was owned by Christopher Wilson and [trained](/wiki/Horse_trainer "Horse trainer") by Tom Perren. Wizard only stood as a [stallion](/wiki/Stallion "Stallion") for two years before dying in an accident in 1813. His son Young Wizard won the [Riddlesworth Stakes](/wiki/Riddlesworth_Stakes "Riddlesworth Stakes") and was the runner-up in the Derby in 1817.

## Background

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wizard_(horse)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Background")]

Wizard was a [chestnut](/wiki/Chestnut_(coat) "Chestnut (coat)") [colt](/wiki/Colt_(horse) "Colt (horse)") foaled in 1806 and bred by Mr. Goodison.[[1]](#cite_note-stud1-1) He was [sired](/wiki/Stallion "Stallion") by [Sorcerer](/wiki/Sorcerer_(horse) "Sorcerer (horse)"), a successful racehorse and three-time [Champion sire in Britain](/wiki/Leading_sire_in_Great_Britain_and_Ireland "Leading sire in Great Britain and Ireland"). Amongst Sorcerer's other progeny were [2000 Guineas](/wiki/2,000_Guineas_Stakes "2,000 Guineas Stakes") and [Derby](/wiki/Epsom_Derby "Epsom Derby") winner [Smolensko](/wiki/Smolensko_(horse) "Smolensko (horse)"), [St. Leger](/wiki/St._Leger_Stakes "St. Leger Stakes") winner [Soothsayer](/wiki/Soothsayer_(horse) "Soothsayer (horse)") and the [Oaks](/wiki/Epsom_Oaks "Epsom Oaks") winners [Morel](/wiki/Morel_(horse) "Morel (horse)"), [Maid of Orleans](/wiki/Maid_of_Orleans_(horse) "Maid of Orleans (horse)") and [Sorcery](/wiki/Sorcery_(horse) "Sorcery (horse)").[[2]](#cite_note-2) Wizard's [dam](/wiki/Mare "Mare") was a daughter of Precipitate. Wizard was the second of her ten [foals](/wiki/Foal "Foal").[[1]](#cite_note-stud1-1) He was trained by Tom Perren.[[3]](#cite_note-eclipse-3)

### 1809: Three-year-old season

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wizard_(horse)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: 1809: Three-year-old season")]

Wizard did not race as a two-year-old and he made his debut on 3 April 1809 in a sweepstakes of 100 [guineas](/wiki/Guinea_(British_coin) "Guinea (British coin)") each at the [Newmarket](/wiki/Newmarket_Racecourse "Newmarket Racecourse") Craven meeting.[[4]](#cite_note-newm1-4) [Ridden](/wiki/Jockey "Jockey") by William Clift, he started the race as the [6/5](/wiki/Fixed-odds_betting "Fixed-odds betting") favourite and won it easily from Chryseis.[[5]](#cite_note-5) Cock Robin finished third, with three others behind him.[[4]](#cite_note-newm1-4) Two weeks later he started 4/5 favourite for the [2000 Guineas Stakes](/wiki/2,000_Guineas_Stakes "2,000 Guineas Stakes") over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket.[[6]](#cite_note-guineas-6) This was the first running of the 2000 Guineas.[[3]](#cite_note-eclipse-3) Also near the front of the betting were Japan at 10/3, Robin at 6/1 and Fair Star at 7/1. Eight runners started the race, which Wizard won from Robin. Fair Star finished third and Japan fourth.[[6]](#cite_note-guineas-6)

Wizard then went to [Epsom Downs](/wiki/Epsom_Downs_Racecourse "Epsom Downs Racecourse") for the [Derby Stakes](/wiki/Epsom_Derby "Epsom Derby"), where he was again ridden by Clift, as he had been in his previous two races.[[7]](#cite_note-derby-7) He started as the odds-on favourite, priced at about 8/11.[[8]](#cite_note-epsom-8) Fair Star was the second favourite, with Salivator third in the betting. Salivator took the lead and held it until the field turned into the finishing straight, where Wizard overtook him. Wizard was in front until a few yards from the finish, where he was passed by [Pope](/wiki/Pope_(horse) "Pope (horse)"), a 20/1 outsider. Pope won the race by a [neck](/wiki/Horse_length "Horse length") from Wizard with Salivator in third and Fair Star in fourth.[[7]](#cite_note-derby-7) In his last race of the season Wizard finished fourth in the [St. Leger Stakes](/wiki/St._Leger_Stakes "St. Leger Stakes") at [Doncaster](/wiki/Doncaster_Racecourse "Doncaster Racecourse"). The race was won by [Ashton](/wiki/Ashton_(horse) "Ashton (horse)"), who had started as favourite.[[9]](#cite_note-leger-9) The St. Leger was the first time Wizard had not been ridden by William Clift, with [Francis Buckle](/wiki/Francis_Buckle "Francis Buckle") riding him.[[10]](#cite_note-10)

### 1810: Four-year-old season

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wizard_(horse)&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: 1810: Four-year-old season")]

Wizard did not reappear as a four-year-old until October, when he defeated Derby winner Pope over 1+1⁄4 miles at Newmarket. Pope had started the race as the 1/2 favourite.[[11]](#cite_note-ten1-11) The following day, Wizard [walked over](/wiki/Walkover "Walkover") for one-third of a subscription of 25 guineas each.[[12]](#cite_note-ten2-12) These were his only two appearances in 1810.

### 1811: Five-year-old season

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wizard_(horse)&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: 1811: Five-year-old season")]

Wizard's first race as a five-year-old was a sweepstakes of 100 guineas each on 20 April at Newmarket. He faced three opponents and won the race from odds-on favourite Spaniard.[[13]](#cite_note-new11a-13) He was then intended to face 1810 Derby winner [Whalebone](/wiki/Whalebone_(horse) "Whalebone (horse)") at Newmarket in early May, but Whalebone's owner, the [4th Duke of Grafton](/wiki/George_FitzRoy,_4th_Duke_of_Grafton "George FitzRoy, 4th Duke of Grafton"), paid a forfeit and the race never took place.[[14]](#cite_note-14) He beat Middlethorpe at Newmarket after Middlethorpe unseated his [rider](/wiki/Jockey "Jockey") in the early stages of the race. The match against Middlethorpe won him 500 guineas.[[15]](#cite_note-middle1-15) The following day he beat Anthonio over 5+1⁄2 furlongs.[[16]](#cite_note-Anthonio-16) He faced Middlethorpe again in September when he fell [lame](/wiki/Lameness_(equine) "Lameness (equine)") and Middlethorpe beat him. This was his final race and he was retired to [stud](/wiki/Stud_(animal) "Stud (animal)").[[17]](#cite_note-middle2-17) Throughout his racing career Wizard earned 3850 guineas.

## Stud career

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Wizard_(horse)&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Stud career")]

Wizard was a [stallion](/wiki/Stallion "Stallion") at Elmsal Lodge near [Ferrybridge](/wiki/Ferrybridge "Ferrybridge"), [Yorkshire](/wiki/Yorkshire "Yorkshire"). In 1812 his stud fee was ten guineas plus half a guinea for the [groom](/wiki/Groom_(profession) "Groom (profession)").[[18]](#cite_note-18) He also stood at Emsal, for the same fee, in 1813.[[19]](#cite_note-19) He only stood as a stallion for these two seasons[[20]](#cite_note-20) and died on 30 June 1813 at Elmsal Lodge two days after running into a post. He broke three [ribs](/wiki/Rib "Rib") and an iron bar attached to the post became so lodged in his [backbone](/wiki/Vertebral_column "Vertebral column") that it took two men to remove it.[[21]](#cite_note-21) Wizard sired three winners of eleven races.

His winning progeny were:

* **Wizard filly** (1813) – won a [maiden race](/wiki/Maiden_race "Maiden race") at Penrith in three two-mile heats in 1816. She ran in the Richmond Cup, but was unplaced.[[22]](#cite_note-22)
* **Warlock** (1814) – won two races at Chesterfield and two races at [Pontefract](/wiki/Pontefract_Racecourse "Pontefract Racecourse") in 1817.[[23]](#cite_note-hathitrust1-23) He also won a race of four three-mile heats at Durham in 1818.[[24]](#cite_note-hathitrust2-24)
* **Young Wizard** (1814) – owned by the [3rd Baron Foley](/wiki/Thomas_Foley,_3rd_Baron_Foley "Thomas Foley, 3rd Baron Foley") and later the [2nd Marquess of Exeter](/wiki/Brownlow_Cecil,_2nd_Marquess_of_Exeter "Brownlow Cecil, 2nd Marquess of Exeter"). As a three-year-old in 1817 he won the [Riddlesworth Stakes](/wiki/Riddlesworth_Stakes "Riddlesworth Stakes") at Newmarket and a Produce Sweepstakes at Doncaster. A match between Young Wizard and Pickaxe at Newmarket finished in a dead heat. He also finished second to [Azor](/wiki/Azor_(horse) "Azor (horse)") in the Derby.[[23]](#cite_note-hathitrust1-23) In 1818 he beat Sir Thomas in a match race[[24]](#cite_note-hathitrust2-24) and won a race at [Ascot Heath](/wiki/Ascot_Racecourse "Ascot Racecourse") in 1819.[[25]](#cite_note-25)

Wizard's descendants include 1963 [Irish 2000 Guineas](/wiki/Irish_2000_Guineas "Irish 2000 Guineas") and 1964 [Queen Elizabeth II Stakes](/wiki/Queen_Elizabeth_II_Stakes "Queen Elizabeth II Stakes") winner Linacre[[26]](#cite_note-26)[[27]](#cite_note-27)[[28]](#cite_note-28) and 1940 [Gran Premio di Milano](/wiki/Gran_Premio_di_Milano "Gran Premio di Milano") winner Sirte.[[29]](#cite_note-29)[[30]](#cite_note-equineline1-30) Through 1948 [Prix Edmond Blanc](/wiki/Prix_Edmond_Blanc "Prix Edmond Blanc") winner Menetrier he is an ancestor of multiple time Canadian Champion sire and [Hall of Fame](/wiki/Canadian_Horse_Racing_Hall_of_Fame "Canadian Horse Racing Hall of Fame") inductee [Vice Regent](/wiki/Vice_Regent "Vice Regent") and his brother [Viceregal](/wiki/Viceregal_(horse) "Viceregal (horse)") and their many descendants (which include [Deputy Minister](/wiki/Deputy_Minister_(horse) "Deputy Minister (horse)"), [Victory Gallop](/wiki/Victory_Gallop "Victory Gallop") and [Trempolino](/wiki/Trempolino "Trempolino")), as well as [Canadian Horse of the Year](/wiki/Canadian_Horse_of_the_Year "Canadian Horse of the Year") [Canebora](/wiki/Canebora "Canebora") and 1979 [Prix du Jockey Club](/wiki/Prix_du_Jockey_Club "Prix du Jockey Club") winner Top Ville.[[30]](#cite_note-equineline1-30)[[31]](#cite_note-31)[[32]](#cite_note-32) All these were descended through another unnamed daughter foaled in 1813, as was Hyacinthus, who won the 1940 [Middle Park Stakes](/wiki/Middle_Park_Stakes "Middle Park Stakes").[[33]](#cite_note-33)[[34]](#cite_note-34) This unnamed daughter of Wizard was never trained to race as she was crippled.[[1]](#cite_note-stud1-1)

Through his 1814 daughter Wizardess his descendants include 1928 [Grand Prix de Paris](/wiki/Grand_Prix_de_Paris "Grand Prix de Paris") winner Cri de Guerre[[35]](#cite_note-35)[[36]](#cite_note-36) and his descendants (including 1972 [Bay Shore Stakes](/wiki/Bay_Shore_Stakes "Bay Shore Stakes") winner Explodent and 1983 [Phoenix Stakes](/wiki/Phoenix_Stakes "Phoenix Stakes") winner King Persian).[[37]](#cite_note-37)

## Pedigree

\* Wizard is [inbred](/wiki/Inbreeding "Inbreeding") 4S × 4S x 4D to the stallion [Matchem](/wiki/Matchem "Matchem"), meaning that he appears fourth generation twice on the sire side of his pedigree and fourth generation once on the dam side of his pedigree.

\* Wizard is inbred 4S × 4D to the mare *Snap mare*, meaning that he appears fourth generation once on the sire side of his pedigree and fourth generation once on the dam side of his pedigree.
