In 2007, [Jade Villalon](/wiki/Jade_Villalon "Jade Villalon"), along with her music partner, Geo, left the [Sweetbox](/wiki/Sweetbox "Sweetbox") project behind, because of ownership issues, to start work on Villalon's new music project, titled under her own name, "Jade Valerie".

She released the mini album *[Out of the Box](/wiki/Out_of_the_Box_(Jade_Valerie_album) "Out of the Box (Jade Valerie album)")*, the title being a play on words of the departure from Sweetbox, to critical acclaim in 2007. Her latest album, *Bittersweet Symphony*, the seventh original album she has released in her career as a singer, reached #15 on the Oricon charts. She re-released *Out of the Box* in Korea, containing some of the tracks from her original album of the same name, as well as many tracks from *Bittersweet Symphony*. She also re-recorded the song "You Don't Know Me" with guest vocalist Kim Dong Wan for this release.

Villalon released a recording of the Christmas carol "Oh Holy Night" in Korea near the end of 2008, for the holiday season. She also released information in a video on her official website, that two new albums were to be expected in 2009, and that the Cheetah Girls had used a song on their recent album that Villalon had written in 2003.
