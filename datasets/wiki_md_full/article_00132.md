## Description

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Circe_(painting)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Description")]

The work features the mythical figure of [Circe](/wiki/Circe "Circe"), [shown nude from behind](/wiki/Nude_art "Nude art"), calmly poised with a [tiger](/wiki/Tiger "Tiger") and another large cat, an [ocelot](/wiki/Ocelot "Ocelot"), on either side. On the background is shown a forest, with a puma, at the left, and two boars, one of them resting, at the right. Circe was a seductive enchantress who featured in [Homer](/wiki/Homer "Homer")'s [epic poem](/wiki/Epic_poem "Epic poem") *[The Odyssey](/wiki/The_Odyssey "The Odyssey")*. Collier was strongly influenced by the [Pre-Raphaelite movement](/wiki/Pre-Raphaelite_movement "Pre-Raphaelite movement"), although the painting reflects the style of [academic art](/wiki/Academic_art "Academic art") of the decade. It was displayed at the [Royal Academy](/wiki/Royal_Academy_of_Arts "Royal Academy of Arts")'s [Summer Exhibition](/wiki/Summer_Exhibition "Summer Exhibition") of 1885 held at [Burlington House](/wiki/Burlington_House "Burlington House") in [London](/wiki/London "London"), where it was hailed as a "remarkable success" in one review.[[3]](#cite_note-3) It was later exhibited at the [World's Columbian Exposition](/wiki/World%27s_Columbian_Exposition "World's Columbian Exposition") in [Chicago](/wiki/Chicago "Chicago") in 1893.
