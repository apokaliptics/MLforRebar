English cricketer

**Alfred Payne** (28 April 1858 – 23 July 1943) was an English [cricketer](/wiki/Cricket "Cricket"). Payne was a right-handed [batsman](/wiki/Batting_(cricket) "Batting (cricket)") whose [bowling](/wiki/Bowling_(cricket) "Bowling (cricket)") style is unknown, though it is known he fielded occasionally as a [wicket-keeper](/wiki/Wicket-keeper "Wicket-keeper"). He was born at [East Grinstead](/wiki/East_Grinstead "East Grinstead"), [Sussex](/wiki/Sussex "Sussex").

Payne made his [first-class](/wiki/First-class_cricket "First-class cricket") debut for [Sussex](/wiki/Sussex_County_Cricket_Club "Sussex County Cricket Club") against the [Marylebone Cricket Club](/wiki/Marylebone_Cricket_Club "Marylebone Cricket Club") at [Lord's](/wiki/Lord%27s "Lord's") in 1880. He made sixteen further first-class appearances for the county, the last of which came against [Gloucestershire](/wiki/Gloucestershire_County_Cricket_Club "Gloucestershire County Cricket Club") in 1886.[[1]](#cite_note-FCM-1) In his seventeen matches for Sussex, he scored 275 runs at an [average](/wiki/Batting_average_(cricket) "Batting average (cricket)") of 9.16, with a high score of 42.[[2]](#cite_note-2) He also made a single first-class appearance for the [Players against the Gentlemen](/wiki/Gentlemen_v_Players "Gentlemen v Players") in 1881.[[1]](#cite_note-FCM-1)

Outside of cricket, Payne worked as a [shoemaker](/wiki/Shoemaking "Shoemaking"), an occupation which had long been associated with his family.[[3]](#cite_note-PRO-3) It is known that by 1881 he was single and living with his parents, William and Harriett, both in their sixties.[[3]](#cite_note-PRO-3) He died at [Uckfield](/wiki/Uckfield "Uckfield"), Sussex, on 23 July 1943. His brother, [William](/wiki/William_Payne_(cricketer) "William Payne (cricketer)"), played first-class cricket, as did his uncles [Charles Payne](/wiki/Charles_Payne_(cricketer,_born_1832) "Charles Payne (cricketer, born 1832)"), [Richard Payne](/wiki/Richard_Payne_(cricketer,_born_1827) "Richard Payne (cricketer, born 1827)") and [Joseph Payne](/wiki/Joseph_Payne_(cricketer) "Joseph Payne (cricketer)").
