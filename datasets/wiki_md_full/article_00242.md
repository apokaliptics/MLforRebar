## Early life

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sarah_Dunant&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Early life")]

Dunant was born in 1950 and raised in London.[[6]](#cite_note-BC-6) She is the daughter of David Dunant, a former Welsh airline steward who later became a manager at [British Airways](/wiki/British_Airways "British Airways"),[[7]](#cite_note-SP-7) and his French wife Estelle, who grew up in [Bangalore](/wiki/Bangalore "Bangalore"), India.

She went to [Godolphin and Latymer](/wiki/Godolphin_and_Latymer_School "Godolphin and Latymer School"), a local girls' grammar school.[[6]](#cite_note-BC-6) She then studied history at [Newnham College, Cambridge](/wiki/Newnham_College,_Cambridge "Newnham College, Cambridge"),[[7]](#cite_note-SP-7) where she was involved in the amateur theatrical club [Footlights](/wiki/Footlights "Footlights"). After she graduated, she earned an actor's [equity card](/wiki/Equity_card "Equity card") and moved to [Tokyo](/wiki/Tokyo "Tokyo"), [Japan](/wiki/Japan "Japan"). In Tokyo, she worked as an English teacher and nightclub hostess for six months, before returning home through Southeast Asia.[[7]](#cite_note-SP-7)

## Broadcasting career

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sarah_Dunant&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Broadcasting career")]

She worked at [BBC Radio 4](/wiki/BBC_Radio_4 "BBC Radio 4") for two years in [London](/wiki/London "London"),[[6]](#cite_note-BC-6) producing its then arts magazine programme [*Kaleidoscope*](/wiki/Kaleidoscope_(UK_radio_series) "Kaleidoscope (UK radio series)"),[[7]](#cite_note-SP-7) before travelling again, this time overland through North, Central and South America, a trip that became research material for her first solo novel *Snow Storms in a Hot Climate* (1988), a thriller about the early [cocaine](/wiki/Cocaine "Cocaine") trade in [Colombia](/wiki/Colombia "Colombia").[[8]](#cite_note-8)

She went on to work extensively in radio and television, most notably as a presenter of [BBC2](/wiki/BBC2 "BBC2")'s late-night live arts programme *[The Late Show](/wiki/The_Late_Show_(British_TV_programme) "The Late Show (British TV programme)")* in the 1990s[[7]](#cite_note-SP-7) and *[Night Waves](/wiki/Night_Waves "Night Waves")*, [BBC Radio 3](/wiki/BBC_Radio_3 "BBC Radio 3")'s nightly cultural discussion programme.

She contributes regularly to radio, as an occasional presenter for BBC Radio 4's opinion slot [*A Point of View*](/wiki/List_of_BBC_Radio_4_programmes "List of BBC Radio 4 programmes").[[9]](#cite_note-9) and more recently delivering a series of five original essays on Isabella d'Este and the art of writing historical fiction, entitled *Unearthing the Past*.

## Writing

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Sarah_Dunant&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Writing")]

Dunant started writing in her late twenties, first with a friend, with whom she produced two political thrillers and a five-part BBC1 drama series – *Thin Air*, starring [Kate Hardie](/wiki/Kate_Hardie "Kate Hardie"), [Nicky Henson](/wiki/Nicky_Henson "Nicky Henson") and [Clive Merrison](/wiki/Clive_Merrison "Clive Merrison"), broadcast in 1988 – before going solo with her thriller *Snow Storms in a Hot Climate*.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]

Her subsequent novels have explored two genres: contemporary thrillers and historical fiction. What unites the two is her decision to use avowedly popular forms, characterised by compelling storytelling, as a way to explore accurate history and serious subject matter to reach a large audience. This has included (though not exclusively) a passionate commitment to feminism and the role of women inside history.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]

In the 1990s, she wrote a trilogy around a British female private eye called Hannah Wolfe, spotlighting issues such as surrogacy, cosmetic surgery, animal rights, and violence to women. Sexual violence was also at the centre of *Transgressions* (based on a mysterious series of incidents happening in her house,[[10]](#cite_note-10) which tackled what might happen if a woman woke to an intruder in her house and lived to tell the tale. The resulting furore over the actions of the heroine "caused the book to become a cause celebre which triggered a debate about rape and popular culture".[[11]](#cite_note-11)

In 2000, an extended visit to [Florence](/wiki/Florence "Florence"), Italy, changed Dunant's working life. In what she acknowledged was something of a midlife crisis,[[1]](#cite_note-New_York_Times-1) her old passion for history was reignited, and she started to research the impact of the [Renaissance](/wiki/Italian_Renaissance "Italian Renaissance") on the city in the 1490s. The result was *The Birth of Venus*,[[1]](#cite_note-New_York_Times-1) the first of a trilogy of novels about women's lives in the Italian Renaissance. The commercial success of these books in America and elsewhere[[12]](#cite_note-bbc.co.uk-12)[[13]](#cite_note-:0-13) allowed Dunant to devote herself full-time to writing and research, concentrating on the most current work being done in Renaissance studies, most particularly concerning the lives of women.[[14]](#cite_note-14) The novel *Sacred Hearts*, a story of nuns in an enclosed convent in 16th-century Ferrara, led to collaboration with the [early music](/wiki/Early_music "Early music") group [Musica Secreta](/wiki/Musica_Secreta "Musica Secreta"): a theatrical adaptation using the music of the period and with a choir, performed in churches and at [early music festivals](/wiki/Early_music_festivals "Early music festivals") around Britain.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]

Since then, she has worked on the history of the Borgia family, seeking to separate the colourful historical truth from the smear and gossip that built up during their lives, and in history after their deaths.[[13]](#cite_note-:0-13) It has made her an advocate for better historical accuracy in popular television series such as *The Borgias*.

Her most recent book *The Marchesa* centres on the extraordinary life of [Isabella d'Este](/wiki/Isabella_d%27Este "Isabella d'Este"), the first female art collector and patron of the [Italian Renaissance](/wiki/Italian_Renaissance "Italian Renaissance"). She left behind her an archive of 33,000 letters of correspondence, from which her voice, charming, cunning , clever and ruthless by degrees sings out. She rubbed shoulders with Popes, kings and bankers, artists like Leonardo, Mantegna, and Titian was a fabulous diplomat running the state while her husband was away fighting, and (in her spare time!) was an icon of fashion and style.

As a journalist, Dunant has reviewed for many UK newspapers, as well as for *The New York Times*, and edited two books of essays on political correctness (*The War of the Words*, 1995) and millennial anxieties (*The Age of Anxiety*, 1996, with Roy Porter). She works regularly in Radio and print.
