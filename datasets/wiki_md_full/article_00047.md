## History

The Iversky Convent was established at the beginning of the 20th century. It was built on the fund of Rostov-on-Don merchant Samuil Fyodorov, who, according to a city legend, had a sixteen-year-old daughter who wished to become a [nun](/wiki/Nun "Nun"). The convent was initially situated about 15 km from the city. The first [Abbess](/wiki/Abbess "Abbess") of the convent was Mother Anastasia. About 50 sisters lived there back then.[[1]](#cite_note-:0-1)

The Iversky Convent was completed and consecrated in 1908. During [World War I](/wiki/World_War_I "World War I"), the convent was also an [orphanage](/wiki/Orphanage "Orphanage") for girls from [Poland](/wiki/Poland "Poland"), who lived here until 1920-s.

In 1919, under the threat of closing the convent, the Abbess Anastasia had to declare nun community as a farming cooperative. At the convent there were [poultry](/wiki/Poultry "Poultry") and cattle yard, a bakery, a kitchen, a large apiary, an orchard, artificial dams for fish breeding and a rose garden. Yet in 1929 the convent was closed, its property was expropriated and Anastasia and some of the sisters were expelled to [Siberia](/wiki/Siberia "Siberia").

The convent was revived on the decree of [Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church](/wiki/Holy_Synod_of_the_Russian_Orthodox_Church "Holy Synod of the Russian Orthodox Church") in 1991. By 2002, the convent had been renovated and in November of the same year it was reconsecrated by the Bishop of Rostov Panteleimon.[[2]](#cite_note-2)
