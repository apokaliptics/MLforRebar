Hotel in Manhattan, New York

The **Thompson Central Park New York** is a 587-room[[4]](#cite_note-4) hotel located at 56th Street in [Midtown Manhattan](/wiki/Midtown_Manhattan "Midtown Manhattan"), New York City. Located near [Central Park](/wiki/Central_Park "Central Park"), the 42-story hotel building houses restaurants, a gym, and other retailers.[[2]](#cite_note-TW-2)

## History

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thompson_Central_Park_New_York_Hotel&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

The hotel opened on March 13, 1981, as the **Hotel Parker Meridien New York**.[[1]](#cite_note-autogenerated1981-1) The hotel opened on Friday the thirteenth, a date considered lucky in France. Because the date is considered unlucky in the U.S., however, the actual grand opening celebration was held a week later, on Friday March 20, 1981. The hotel was developed by the New York-based [Jack Parker Corporation](/w/index.php?title=Jack_Parker_Corporation&action=edit&redlink=1 "Jack Parker Corporation (page does not exist)") and managed by [Air France](/wiki/Air_France "Air France")'s [Meridien Hotels](/wiki/Le_M%C3%A9ridien "Le Méridien") division. In 1979, the [New York City Department of City Planning](/wiki/New_York_City_Department_of_City_Planning "New York City Department of City Planning") gave Parker permission to construct a 40-story building, eight floors past the 32-story maximum for a building with that lot area, provided that the corporation add a public atrium. The hotel was later slightly renamed, becoming **Le Parker Méridien New York**. The atrium seating was removed in 1990, and subsequently restored after a "high-profile" campaign by the [New York City Department of Buildings](/wiki/New_York_City_Department_of_Buildings "New York City Department of Buildings").[[5]](#cite_note-5) Under the Parker Corporation's management, Le Parker Meridien was one of the few luxury hotels in the city that accommodated wild animals as guests.[[6]](#cite_note-6) In 2012, the hotel's coffee bar was flooded with concrete following a construction accident at a neighboring building.[[7]](#cite_note-7)

The hotel, along with its sister Le Parker Méridien property in Palm Springs, left Le Méridien (by that point, a division of [Starwood](/wiki/Starwood_Hotels_and_Resorts "Starwood Hotels and Resorts")) in January 2018, and the hotel was renamed **Parker New York Hotel**. GFI Capital Resources Group and [Elliott Management Corporation](/wiki/Elliott_Management_Corporation "Elliott Management Corporation") purchased the hotel for approximately $420 million in 2019. The companies planned a $100 million renovation, along with the conversion of a portion to private residences,[[8]](#cite_note-WSJ-8) and the potential addition of 67 luxury condos atop the existing structure.[[9]](#cite_note-9)[[10]](#cite_note-10) The hotel joined the Thompson Hotels division of [Hyatt](/wiki/Hyatt "Hyatt") as **Thompson Central Park New York**  on November 1, 2021.[[11]](#cite_note-11) In September 2024, Gencom bought the hotel for around $310 million.[[12]](#cite_note-12)[[13]](#cite_note-13)

## Facilities

One of the hotel's restaurants is Burger Joint, a "speakeasy-style burger hut" behind the hotel's lobby curtain.[[14]](#cite_note-14) The restaurant opened in 2002 and has since expanded to other locations. Burger Joint was ranked number two in *[Eater New York](/wiki/Eater_(website) "Eater (website)")*'s list of the "27 Top Burgers in NYC".[[15]](#cite_note-15) People often queue in the restaurant's entrance corridor, which is marked by a simple neon sign of a hamburger.[[16]](#cite_note-16)

## Reception

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Thompson_Central_Park_New_York_Hotel&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Reception")]

Douglas Rogers of *[The Daily Telegraph](/wiki/The_Daily_Telegraph "The Daily Telegraph")* rated the hotel 8 out of 10 and summarized, "At first glance this Midtown hotel seems like a nondescript commercial tower block, but once inside a myriad of resort-like treats await. Aside from sprawling guest rooms there's a barbershop, makeup salon, spa, rooftop pool and – the ultimate gem – world famous Burger Joint."[[17]](#cite_note-17) Parker New York ranked number 118 on *[U.S. News & World Report](/wiki/U.S._News_%26_World_Report "U.S. News & World Report")*'s list of "Best New York City Hotels".[[18]](#cite_note-18) Jessica Colley Clarke of [Fodor's](/wiki/Fodor%27s "Fodor's") rated Le Parker Meridien as 4.5 out of 5 stars,[[19]](#cite_note-19) and [Frommer's](/wiki/Frommer%27s "Frommer's") rated Parker New York 2 out of 3 stars.[[20]](#cite_note-20)

The *[Evening Standard](/wiki/Evening_Standard "Evening Standard")*'s Lauren Keary included the Parker in her list of "best pools in NYC".[[21]](#cite_note-21) Lorna Parkes of *The Independent* described the hotel as "a Hyatt with subtle style" and a "secret burger joint".[[22]](#cite_note-22) *The Daily Telegraph*'s Tracy Kaler included the Parker in her 2020 list of "8 fabulous family-friendly hotels in New York".[[23]](#cite_note-23)
