## Early life and education

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Linda_Wolf&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Early life and education")]

Wolf was born in [Los Angeles](/wiki/Los_Angeles,_California "Los Angeles, California") in 1950 and grew up in [Sherman Oaks, California](/wiki/Sherman_Oaks,_California "Sherman Oaks, California"). Her mother, Barbara Wolf (née Friedman), is a [poet](/wiki/Poet "Poet") and was a fashion model and English literature teacher at [Beverly Hills High School](/wiki/Beverly_Hills_High_School "Beverly Hills High School"). Her father, Joseph Wolf, was a businessman and avid photographer. Linda's interest in photography was born out of her father's passion for photography. He bought her first camera for her when she was a teenager.

Linda Wolf graduated from [Hollywood High School](/wiki/Hollywood_High_School "Hollywood High School") in 1968. In 1969, she began dating Sandy Konikoff, the drummer for [Jackson Browne](/wiki/Jackson_Browne "Jackson Browne"). Konikoff invited her to live at Paxton Lodge in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, where [Elektra Records](/wiki/Elektra_Records "Elektra Records") was recording one of Browne's first albums. There was a darkroom at the studio, and she was inspired by the experience and made a decision to pursue photography professionally.

Wolf's grandfather, Jules Wolf, managed the historic [Lincoln Theater](/wiki/Lincoln_Theater_(Los_Angeles,_California) "Lincoln Theater (Los Angeles, California)"), often called the Apollo of the West.[[4]](#cite_note-4) From 1970 to 1975, she lived and studied in [Provence, France](/wiki/Provence "Provence"), attending the [Institute for American Universities](/wiki/IAU_College "IAU College") and L'Ecole Experimental Photographic.[[5]](#cite_note-5)

Her early photographic work in France focused on people and village life in the [Vaucluse Mountains](/wiki/Vaucluse_Mountains "Vaucluse Mountains").[[6]](#cite_note-6) Next, Wolf attended [Evergreen State College](/wiki/Evergreen_State_College "Evergreen State College") in [Olympia, Washington](/wiki/Olympia,_Washington "Olympia, Washington"). She taught photography through the [University of California](/wiki/University_of_California "University of California") at Los Angeles Extension and worked as a staff photographer for the Los Angeles Citywide Mural Project.[[7]](#cite_note-7)

## Rock and roll photography

### 1969 – Fanny

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Linda_Wolf&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: 1969 – Fanny")]

In 1969, Wolf began working at Warner Bros./Reprise Records, where she met the first all-girl rock band to sign with a major record label, [Fanny](/wiki/Fanny_(band) "Fanny (band)"). She became friends with the band and she moved in with the group at Fanny Hill, a mansion on Marmont Lane in [Hollywood](/wiki/Hollywood,_Los_Angeles "Hollywood, Los Angeles"), where she lived for a year and a half as the band's documentary photographer. Over 80 of Wolf's archival photos of Fanny are presented in the documentary of the band, Fanny: The Right to Rock[[8]](#cite_note-8) During her stay, she met [Lowell George](/wiki/Lowell_George "Lowell George") who started [Little Feat](/wiki/Little_Feat "Little Feat") and the band members from Little Feat. She photographed them as well.[[9]](#cite_note-9)

### 1970 – Joe Cocker: Mad Dogs & Englishmen tour

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Linda_Wolf&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: 1970 – Joe Cocker: Mad Dogs & Englishmen tour")]

Wolf met [Joe Cocker](/wiki/Joe_Cocker "Joe Cocker") a week before the Joe Cocker: Mad Dogs & Englishmen tour began. He had just arrived in the U.S. and was staying with his roadie and keyboard player at [Leon Russell](/wiki/Leon_Russell "Leon Russell")'s house. His record label informed him that he was to start a U.S. tour in six days, but he had just recently left his band, [The Grease Band](/wiki/The_Grease_Band "The Grease Band"). Russell offered to quickly assemble a touring band and recruited over 40 of his friends. Denny Cordell, who produced the tour, invited Wolf along after seeing her photography. She and Andee Nathanson were the two official photographers for the two-month U.S. concert tour which included Russell, [Rita Coolidge](/wiki/Rita_Coolidge "Rita Coolidge"), [Chris Stainton](/wiki/Chris_Stainton "Chris Stainton"), [Claudia Lennear](/wiki/Claudia_Lennear "Claudia Lennear"), [Bobby Keys](/wiki/Bobby_Keys "Bobby Keys"), [Pamela Polland](/wiki/Pamela_Polland "Pamela Polland"), [Matthew Moore](/wiki/Matthew_Moore "Matthew Moore"), and musicians representing the [Tulsa Sound](/wiki/Tulsa_Sound "Tulsa Sound") including [Carl Radle](/wiki/Carl_Radle "Carl Radle"), [Jim Keltner](/wiki/Jim_Keltner "Jim Keltner"), and Chuck Blackwell.

The music documentary *Joe Cocker: Mad Dogs & Englishmen* was released in 1971 and credited Wolf for her tour photography.[[10]](#cite_note-10) She wrote *Joe Cocker: Mad Dogs & Englishmen: A Memory Book*, which included over 150 new photographs, quotes and stories from alumni. It was released in 2015 at the Lockn' Festival.

On September 11, 2015, Wolf joined the [Tedeschi Trucks Band](/wiki/Tedeschi_Trucks_Band "Tedeschi Trucks Band") & Friends and alumni from the 1970 Mad Dogs & Englishmen Tour, as the official photographer, and sang in the encore with the Space Choir, for a tribute concert to honor Joe Cocker and the Mad Dogs and Englishmen music. Participating alumni included [Leon Russell](/wiki/Leon_Russell "Leon Russell"), [Rita Coolidge](/wiki/Rita_Coolidge "Rita Coolidge"), [Claudia Lennear](/wiki/Claudia_Lennear "Claudia Lennear"), [Chris Stainton](/wiki/Chris_Stainton "Chris Stainton"), and [Pamela Polland](/wiki/Pamela_Polland "Pamela Polland").[[11]](#cite_note-11)

Cocker died on December 22, 2014, and Wolf's photographs were used in [Associated Press](/wiki/Associated_Press "Associated Press") articles written about his life and music legacy.[[12]](#cite_note-12)[[13]](#cite_note-13)

### 2020 – *Tribute: Cocker Power*

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Linda_Wolf&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: 2020 – Tribute: Cocker Power")]

On April 28, 2020, Insight Editions released *Tribute: Cocker Power*, a 335-page coffee table book featuring Wolf's documentary photos, tour alumni stories, and vignettes from the [Joe Cocker](/wiki/Joe_Cocker "Joe Cocker"): [Mad Dogs & Englishmen Tour](/wiki/Mad_Dogs_and_Englishmen_(album) "Mad Dogs and Englishmen (album)") and the 2015 tribute concert at the [Lockn' Festival](/wiki/Lockn%27_Festival "Lockn' Festival") led by the [Tedeschi Trucks Band](/wiki/Tedeschi_Trucks_Band "Tedeschi Trucks Band") with [Leon Russell](/wiki/Leon_Russell "Leon Russell") and original tour alumni. The book, which received favorable reviews, was released on the 50th anniversary of the tour. It includes contributions from over one hundred musicians and crew members, including [Denny Cordell](/wiki/Denny_Cordell "Denny Cordell"), [Leon Russell](/wiki/Leon_Russell "Leon Russell"), [Chris Stainton](/wiki/Chris_Stainton "Chris Stainton"), [Rita Coolidge](/wiki/Rita_Coolidge "Rita Coolidge"), [Claudia Lennear](/wiki/Claudia_Lennear "Claudia Lennear"), [Derek Trucks](/wiki/Derek_Trucks "Derek Trucks"), [Susan Tedeschi](/wiki/Susan_Tedeschi "Susan Tedeschi"), and [Warren Haynes](/wiki/Warren_Haynes "Warren Haynes").[[14]](#cite_note-14)

## Public art projects

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Linda_Wolf&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Public art projects")]

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Wolf created a public art project of murals consisting of photos of ordinary people sitting on bus benches. The photographs were placed on the sides of buses and the backs of bus benches in Los Angeles, [San Diego](/wiki/San_Diego "San Diego"), and [Oakland, California](/wiki/Oakland,_California "Oakland, California") in the U.S., and in [Arles, France](/wiki/Arles "Arles"). The benches were conceived as a response to the dehumanizing effects of advertising;[[15]](#cite_note-15)[[16]](#cite_note-16)[[17]](#cite_note-17) they were exhibited in numerous venues including the Los Angeles Municipal Art Gallery and the [Rencontres International Festival of Photography in Arles](/wiki/Rencontres_d%27Arles "Rencontres d'Arles").[[18]](#cite_note-18) One of the benches sits in the courtyard of [Musée Réattu](/wiki/Mus%C3%A9e_R%C3%A9attu "Musée Réattu") as part of their permanent collection in Arles.[[19]](#cite_note-19)[*[better source needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:NOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")*]

Wolf then developed the project *L.A. Welcomes the World*, a series of large-scale multicultural portraits of people presented on billboards throughout Los Angeles, for the 1984 Summer Olympics, which was sponsored by [Eastman Kodak](/wiki/Eastman_Kodak "Eastman Kodak").[[20]](#cite_note-20)
