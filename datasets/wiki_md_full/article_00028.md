Reference to the north Atlantic coastal plain region

**Tidewater** is a region in the [Atlantic Plains](/wiki/Atlantic_Plain "Atlantic Plain") of the United States located east of the [Atlantic Seaboard fall line](/wiki/Atlantic_Seaboard_Fall_Line "Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line") (the natural border where the tidewater meets with the Piedmont region) and north of the [Deep South](/wiki/Deep_South "Deep South"). The term "tidewater" can be applied to any region where water levels are affected by the tide. Still, culturally and historically, the Tidewater region refers most commonly to the low-lying plains of southeastern [Virginia](/wiki/Virginia "Virginia") (known as the [coastal plain](/wiki/Coastal_plain "Coastal plain") or Tidewater Virginia), eastern [Maryland](/wiki/Maryland "Maryland"), the [Eastern Shore](/wiki/Eastern_Shore_of_Virginia "Eastern Shore of Virginia"), and the [Chesapeake Bay](/wiki/Chesapeake_Bay "Chesapeake Bay").[[1]](#cite_note-:18-1) It can also encompass [Delaware](/wiki/Delaware "Delaware"), the remainder of the [Delmarva Peninsula](/wiki/Delmarva_Peninsula "Delmarva Peninsula"), and northeastern [North Carolina](/wiki/North_Carolina "North Carolina").

The cultural Tidewater region got its name from the effects of changing ocean [tides](/wiki/Tides "Tides") on local [rivers](/wiki/River "River"), [sounds](/wiki/Sound_(geography) "Sound (geography)"), and shorelines.[[1]](#cite_note-:18-1) The area has a centuries-old cultural heritage that sets itself apart from the adjacent inland parts of the United States, especially concerning its distinctive dialects of English, which are gradually disappearing,[[2]](#cite_note-:21-2) along with its islands and its receding shoreline.[[3]](#cite_note-:22-3)

## History

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tidewater_Region&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

### Indigenous populations

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tidewater_Region&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Indigenous populations")]

Most Native Americans in the Tidewater region were [Algonkian](/wiki/Algonquian_languages "Algonquian languages")-speaking tribes who lived from the fall line eastward to the Chesapeake Bay and south to the [Albemarle](/wiki/Albemarle_Sound "Albemarle Sound") and [Pamlico Sounds](/wiki/Pamlico_Sound "Pamlico Sound"). From north to south, they inhabited the area from the [Potomac River](/wiki/Potomac_River "Potomac River") in Maryland to the [Neuse River](/wiki/Neuse_River "Neuse River") in North Carolina. Two tribes, the [Accomac](/wiki/Accomac_people "Accomac people") and the [Accohanoc](/wiki/Accomac_people "Accomac people"), also Algonkian-speaking, lived on the Eastern Shore.[[4]](#cite_note-:1-4) [John Smith](/wiki/John_Smith_(explorer) "John Smith (explorer)")'s region map, which has been deemed quite accurate compared to modern maps, shows about 200 villages with king's house symbols indicating tribal capitals. The Algonkian tribes in the Tidewater region were occasionally at war between themselves and with tribes to the north and west, and they were enemies with [Siouan](/wiki/Siouan_languages "Siouan languages") tribes west of the fall line in the Piedmont region. To the south were [Iroquoian](/wiki/Iroquoian_languages "Iroquoian languages")-speaking tribes.[[5]](#cite_note-:2-5)

The natives were hunters, gatherers, and fishers and depended on corn (maize), beans, and squash,[[6]](#cite_note-:3-6) which they grew in the region's rich soils. By continuously growing corn, they were susceptible to crop failure.[[7]](#cite_note-:0-7) They fished and ate berries and nuts in the spring and summer, ate grown vegetables in the summer and fall, and hunted for deer, turkey, squirrel, rabbit, etc. in the winter. Deer was used for clothing and tools as well as food. Each tribe had a chief, Werowances if male and Werowansquas if female. Political power was inherited and passed down through the female line. The [Powhatans](/wiki/Powhatan "Powhatan") lived in villages along rivers and banks in houses called yehakins made from a tree framework covered in bark or marsh reed mats. Men hunted and fished while women farmed, made clothing, and cooked. Children learned these skills from adults and played. Tattoos of animals and nature were common, and clothes were made from deerskin and woven grasses. Necklaces and earrings made from shells and pearls showed wealth.[[6]](#cite_note-:3-6)

The Virginia Algonquians (also known as the "Southeastern Algonkian") were part of the [Powhatan Confederacy](/wiki/Tsenacommacah "Tsenacommacah") which originated around the [James River](/wiki/James_River "James River") and encompassed the [Pamunkey](/wiki/Pamunkey_River "Pamunkey River") and [Mattaponi Rivers](/wiki/Mattaponi_River "Mattaponi River") to the north. Eventually, the confederacy included more than 30 Algonquian tribes east of the fall line including the [Pumunkey](/wiki/Pamunkey "Pamunkey"), [Nansemond](/wiki/Nansemond "Nansemond"), and [Chickahomony](/wiki/Chickahominy_people "Chickahominy people"), the three largest tribes in Virginia, as well as the [Accomac](/wiki/Accomac_people "Accomac people") and [Accohanoc](/wiki/Accomac_people "Accomac people") on the southern tip of the Eastern Shore.[[5]](#cite_note-:2-5)

The original confederacy is estimated to have had around 1,750-1,850 members before expanding to have 8,000-9,000. The Eastern Shore had 400 members; the rest lived on the mainland with a slight majority living in the [Northern Neck](/wiki/Northern_Neck "Northern Neck") and South of the James River. The more loyal and powerful tribes of the confederacy, like the Pumunkey, lived between the James and [Rappahannock Rivers](/wiki/Rappahannock_River "Rappahannock River"). There are accounts of chiefs of tribes further away, like the Potomac and Accomac, who defied the authority of [Powhatan](/wiki/Powhatan_(Native_American_leader) "Powhatan (Native American leader)").[[5]](#cite_note-:2-5)

Powhatan, originally named Wahunsonacock,[[6]](#cite_note-:3-6) was the chief of the Powhatan Confederacy. He was also the father of [Pocahontas](/wiki/Pocahontas "Pocahontas").[[8]](#cite_note-8) He grew his dominion by conquering many of the tribes that joined, including the [Chesapeake](/wiki/Chesapeake_people "Chesapeake people"), Kecoughtan, and Piankatank tribes according to natives that interacted with the [Jamestown](/wiki/Jamestown,_Virginia "Jamestown, Virginia") colonists. Powhatan's relative, [Opechancanough](/wiki/Opechancanough "Opechancanough") (it's unknown if he is a brother, half-brother, or cousin),[[9]](#cite_note-:4-9) was the tribal chief of the Pumunkey before succeeding Powhatan as the chief of the confederacy after his death.[[5]](#cite_note-:2-5)

#### Native-English interaction

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tidewater_Region&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Native-English interaction")]

The Carolina Algonquians were the first natives to come in contact with English settlers at the failed colony on [Roanoke Island](/wiki/Roanoke_Island "Roanoke Island").[[7]](#cite_note-:0-7) At the start of English settlement in the region in the early 17th century, there was a shift in tribal locations, as many natives moved west or further south into current North Carolina to avoid colonists. After the establishment of the first English settlement at Jamestown in 1607, Powhatan moved from Werowocomoco on the [York River](/wiki/York_River_(Virginia) "York River (Virginia)") westward to Orapaks on the [Chickahomony River](/wiki/Chickahominy_River "Chickahominy River"). Many tribes moved south in the 1630s and 1650s after the [Indian Massacres of 1622](/wiki/Indian_massacre_of_1622 "Indian massacre of 1622") (also called the Powhatan Uprising of 1622) and 1644.

Opechancanough led these uprisings against the colonists starting on March 22, 1622 in which tribes in the Powhatan Confederacy surprise attacked and killed or captured approximately 347 English, about a quarter of the colonists. Their tactic was to enter settlement homes friendly, as this was now normalized, before attacking. The Jamestown settlement was warned by a Christianized native the night before and escaped harm. These attacks rose tensions between the natives and the English and incited a ten-year long [Anglo-Powhatan war](/wiki/Anglo-Powhatan_Wars "Anglo-Powhatan Wars"). On the morning of the first uprising, the process resulting in Indian reservations began.[[9]](#cite_note-:4-9) Opechancanough led another uprising in 1644 which killed almost 500 colonists,[[10]](#cite_note-:7-10) but he was captured and killed in captivity. In 1675, fighting ensued between the English and [Susquehannocks](/wiki/Susquehannock "Susquehannock") due to the English trying to push them out of the land in Virginia and Maryland.[[11]](#cite_note-:6-11) By the early 18th century, some natives adopted Christianity and English culture.[[7]](#cite_note-:0-7)

### English settlement

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tidewater_Region&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: English settlement")]

#### Roanoke Island

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tidewater_Region&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Roanoke Island")]

The first English colony, [Roanoke Colony](/wiki/Roanoke_Colony "Roanoke Colony"), was established on Roanoke Island in 1587 in the current [Outer Banks](/wiki/Outer_Banks "Outer Banks") of North Carolina.[[12]](#cite_note-:5-12) The colony consisted of men, women, and children sent by [Sir Walter Raleigh](/wiki/Walter_Raleigh "Walter Raleigh"), the leading Englishman in colonial establishments.[[13]](#cite_note-13) The settlers explored the Pamlico and Albemarle sounds and rivers and documented new animal and plant species.[[7]](#cite_note-:0-7) Because of the infertile soil, the colonists resorted to taking food from neighboring natives which resulted in fighting.[[11]](#cite_note-:6-11) A month into the establishment, [Governor John White](/wiki/John_White_(colonist_and_artist) "John White (colonist and artist)") left the island, promising to return in three month. However, he returned three year later in 1590 to find all the inhabitants and their houses gone[[12]](#cite_note-:5-12) with the letter "CRO" carved into a tree and the word "Croatoan" carved onto a post. Governor White speculated that they moved to the land occupied by the Croatoan tribe but couldn't search for them and returned to England.[[10]](#cite_note-:7-10)

#### Jamestown Settlement

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tidewater_Region&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Jamestown Settlement")]

In May of 1607, the first successful English colony was established on the James River in Jamestown, Virginia. When the 104 men arrived, they found fertile soils, meadows, tall trees, and an abundance of fish, oysters, and crabs, and set out in search of gold. They built a chapel from wood which burned down in 1608 and was rebuilt to be the largest building in the settlement. The church was where [John Rolfe](/wiki/John_Rolfe "John Rolfe") and Pocahontas were wed.[[11]](#cite_note-:6-11)

Few of the colonists knew artisan skills necessary for survival. The colonists struggled with [Malaria](/wiki/Malaria "Malaria") from the mosquitos that inhabited the swamps, other diseases like [typhoid fever](/wiki/Typhoid_fever "Typhoid fever") and [dysentery](/wiki/Dysentery "Dysentery"),[[10]](#cite_note-:7-10) a lack of fresh water, winter famines, and strained relationships with the natives that they encountered. Within the first month of settlement, the Powhatans had attacked the colonists' fort before the Chief sent messengers to ask for friendship. However, interaction between the two groups were often unstable as they both traded and fought.[[14]](#cite_note-:8-14) By the end of the first winter, only 38 of the original settlers had survived. In 1608, 200 more were sent to the colony.[[10]](#cite_note-:7-10) The colony struggled until [tobacco](/wiki/Tobacco "Tobacco") became its economic driver and cash crop.[[14]](#cite_note-:8-14)

#### Albemarle colony

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tidewater_Region&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Albemarle colony")]

The settlers continued to explore the Albemarle-Pamlico region and starting in 1653, they expanded their colony into this area. Most settlers who moved south to Carolina from Jamestown were [Quakers](/wiki/Quakers "Quakers") seeking religious freedom. The settlers here changed the ecosystem by digging ditches and canals which drained the swampland, cutting down forests, building river dams, and attempting to drain lakes. They overtook the natives who lived there and farmed on the land, adopting the planting of maize, planting their own rice, wheat, and tobacco, and raising livestock.[[7]](#cite_note-:0-7)

#### Maryland colony

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tidewater_Region&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Maryland colony")]

In 1634, the colony of [St. Mary's](/wiki/St._Mary%27s_County,_Maryland "St. Mary's County, Maryland") was established near the Potomac River at the arrival of around 200 settlers. The colony was established to be a refuge for [English Catholics](/wiki/Catholic_Church_in_England_and_Wales "Catholic Church in England and Wales") prosecuted by [Protestants](/wiki/Protestantism "Protestantism"). However, most who came were Protestants,[[10]](#cite_note-:7-10) although there were also Catholics, Quakers, and [Puritans](/wiki/Puritans "Puritans"). The religious diversity in the area merited the creation of the 1649 "[Act Concerning Religion](/wiki/Maryland_Toleration_Act "Maryland Toleration Act")" that allowed free exercise of religion as long as the religion was a Christian denomination,[[11]](#cite_note-:6-11) although it did little to solve religious turmoil.

### Colonial history

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tidewater_Region&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Colonial history")]

#### Indentured servitude and slavery

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tidewater_Region&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Indentured servitude and slavery")]

Before slavery, [indentured servants](/wiki/Indentured_servitude "Indentured servitude") were the predominant source of labor in Virginia and Maryland. English indentured servants exchanged four or seven years of free labor in return for passage to America and fifty acres of land after their release.[[10]](#cite_note-:7-10)[[11]](#cite_note-:6-11) Indentured servants in the 1700s tended to arrive from Ireland and came in families. Criminals from England were also sent in 1718.

Slavery was more appealing to planters because, unlike indentured servants, slaves were to work their whole lives and could not be freed and given parcels of land that could compete with owners. In 1619, the first Africans arrived at Jamestown by a Dutch ship. They had been baptized and could not be sold as slaves and instead were sold as servants. By 1649, 300 Africans, a mix of slaves, indentured servants, and free, were living in Virginia. Africans went south to the Albemarle region in 1653 with other English settlers.[[7]](#cite_note-:0-7) By the 1660s, most Africans were either servants for life or slaves. During the 18th century, slavery significantly increased in Virginia from 12,000 slaves in 1708 to 120,000 in 1756. Maryland and the Carolinas saw similar increases, with slaves outnumbering whites in South Carolina by 1708. The three types of slaves were skilled workers (carpenters, blacksmiths, tailors, etc.), house servants (cooks, maids, nurses), and field hands who worked in the tobacco fields.[[10]](#cite_note-:7-10)

#### Colonial governments

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tidewater_Region&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Colonial governments")]

In 1619, the [Virginia Company of London](/wiki/Virginia_Company_of_London "Virginia Company of London") authorized for every adult male in Virginia to elect a legislature called the [House of Burgesses](/wiki/House_of_Burgesses "House of Burgesses"). In its first meeting, the House passed laws concerning Native American relations and conversion, agriculture, land and labor, religion, and morals. This was the first form of self-government that the colonists had.

Each colony also had its own governor, usually appointed or elected by the King of England, that served for a term of five years. The governor held essentially all power in the colony and could veto any acts passed by the House of Burgesses and was in charge of the colony's militia. The governor had a council of seven to twelve members that approved bills and served as the supreme court of the colony. Eventually, the [House of Commons](/wiki/House_of_Commons_of_the_United_Kingdom "House of Commons of the United Kingdom") granted the assembly the power to makes their own rules, elect their own speaker, and control money.[[10]](#cite_note-:7-10)

### Revolutionary War

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tidewater_Region&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Revolutionary War")]

Much of the [American Revolution](/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War "American Revolutionary War")'s strategy and battles took place in the Tidewater region of Virginia and North Carolina. [Lafayette](/wiki/Marquis_de_Lafayette "Marquis de Lafayette") planned to attack [Benedict Arnold](/wiki/Benedict_Arnold "Benedict Arnold") who had defected to the British in [Portsmouth, Virginia](/wiki/Portsmouth,_Virginia "Portsmouth, Virginia"). Troops also traveled through and fought on and around the James River, the Chesapeake Bay, the Richmond area, [Norfolk](/wiki/Norfolk,_Virginia "Norfolk, Virginia"), and [Williamsburg](/wiki/Williamsburg,_Virginia "Williamsburg, Virginia").[[15]](#cite_note-:19-15) During the 1775 [Battle of Great Bridge](/wiki/Battle_of_Great_Bridge "Battle of Great Bridge"), the British, led by Lord Dunmore, tried to cross from the Albemarle region in North Carolina to Norfolk, Virginia where they were attacked and defeated by Patriots. Norfolk was later attacked and partially destroyed by Dunmore and his troops on New Year's Day in 1776. The Patriots were also responsible for the damage to Norfolk in attempt to deny it from the British. Because of the destruction of Norfolk, the largest military port between New York and Charleston, [Lord Cornwallis](/wiki/Charles_Cornwallis,_1st_Marquess_Cornwallis "Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis") decided to move his troops to [Yorktown](/wiki/Yorktown,_Virginia "Yorktown, Virginia").[[16]](#cite_note-:20-16)

One of the most significant roles that the Tidewater region played in the revolution was the [Siege of Yorktown](/wiki/Siege_of_Yorktown "Siege of Yorktown") which ended the war. The [Yorktown campaign](/wiki/Yorktown_campaign "Yorktown campaign"), with the help of French allies, began in [Petersburg](/wiki/Petersburg,_Virginia "Petersburg, Virginia") and made its way through the [Virginia Peninsula](/wiki/Virginia_Peninsula "Virginia Peninsula") to Yorktown where Cornwallis was forced to surrender 8,000 British forces.[[15]](#cite_note-:19-15)[[16]](#cite_note-:20-16)

### American Civil War

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tidewater_Region&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: American Civil War")]

The [Virginia Peninsula](/wiki/Virginia_Peninsula "Virginia Peninsula") located between the James and York rivers was a significant location throughout the [Civil War](/wiki/American_Civil_War "American Civil War"). [Fort Monroe](/wiki/Fort_Monroe "Fort Monroe") in Hampton, Virginia was the only fort controlled by Union forces in the South. It was a strategic location for controlling the Chesapeake Bay and ports like Newport News Point, [Hampton](/wiki/Hampton,_Virginia "Hampton, Virginia"), and Norfolk, serving as a prime location for Union military operations. It also became a haven for slaves looking to escape to Union territory. Another installation in the area was [Gosport Naval Yard](/wiki/Norfolk_Naval_Shipyard "Norfolk Naval Shipyard") which Confederate forces took control of in 1861.[[17]](#cite_note-17)[[18]](#cite_note-18)

Many battles were fought in the Tidewater region including the [Battle of Big Bethel](/wiki/Battle_of_Big_Bethel "Battle of Big Bethel") in York County and Hampton, the Blockade of the [Chesapeake Bay](/wiki/Chesapeake_Bay "Chesapeake Bay") and [Potomac River](/wiki/Potomac_River "Potomac River"), multiple in North Carolina (such as [Roanoke Island](/wiki/Roanoke_Island "Roanoke Island"), [New Bern](/wiki/New_Bern "New Bern"), and [Fort Macon](/wiki/Fort_Macon "Fort Macon")), and the Peninsula Campaign which included the [Siege of Yorktown](/wiki/Siege_of_Yorktown_(1862) "Siege of Yorktown (1862)"), [Battle of Hampton Roads](/wiki/Battle_of_Hampton_Roads "Battle of Hampton Roads") and [Battle of Williamsburg](/wiki/Battle_of_Williamsburg "Battle of Williamsburg").[[19]](#cite_note-19)

## Geography

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tidewater_Region&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Geography")]

The land in the Tidewater region is generally flat and low, with large expanses near the tidal shorelines composed of [tidal marsh](/wiki/Tidal_marsh "Tidal marsh") and [swamp](/wiki/Swamp "Swamp"). Much of the area is covered with [pocosin](/wiki/Pocosin "Pocosin") and the higher areas are used for agricultural farmlands.

The underlying structure of the region is a solid rock foundation that formed 250-500 million years ago and is covered with eroded clay, sand, and gravel carried eastward by rivers.[[20]](#cite_note-:12-20) The salinity of the water in the region gradually changes from freshwater inland to [brackish](/wiki/Brackish_water "Brackish water") and saltwater closer to the coast.[[7]](#cite_note-:0-7)

### Geological history

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tidewater_Region&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Geological history")]

During the last ice age (25,000 years ago), although the region was not glaciated, the Atlantic sea level was significantly lower than today. This resulted in more land on the coasts, extending fifty more miles eastward than today.[[20]](#cite_note-:12-20) Hence, many of the current North Carolina sounds and the Chesapeake Bay had not formed yet. Rather, what are now rivers like the [Pamlico](/wiki/Pamlico_River "Pamlico River"), James, and [Susquehanna](/wiki/Susquehanna_River "Susquehanna River") that flow into the Chesapeake Bay and the North Carolina sounds previously flowed directly into the Atlantic Ocean.[[7]](#cite_note-:0-7)

The Tidewater region developed when sea levels rose after ice sheets melted at the end of the last ice age, resulting in the flooding of river valleys in the coastal plain and the Chesapeake lowland which created the Chesapeake Bay.[[20]](#cite_note-:12-20) Such flooded river valleys now make up the Tidewater region as tides continue to affect water levels far inland, in some cases all the way west to the fall line. The region stretches into the Atlantic Ocean at the point where warm water from the [Gulf Stream](/wiki/Gulf_Stream "Gulf Stream") starts to deflect away from the coast.[[7]](#cite_note-:0-7)

### Geographic location and boundaries

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tidewater_Region&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Geographic location and boundaries")]

Geographically, in North Carolina and Virginia the Tidewater area is the land between the fall line and the Atlantic Ocean. In Maryland, the Tidewater area is the flooded river areas below the fall line. Southern Maryland,[[21]](#cite_note-21) the Eastern Shore, and Delaware round out the northern part of the region on the Chesapeake and Delaware Bays. In the case of Virginia, the Tidewater region includes [Hampton Roads](/wiki/Hampton_Roads "Hampton Roads"), the rest of the Virginia Peninsula, the [Middle Peninsula](/wiki/Middle_Peninsula "Middle Peninsula"), the [Northern Neck](/wiki/Northern_Neck "Northern Neck"), and the Eastern Shore.

### Climate

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tidewater_Region&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Climate")]

The tidewater region has a warm, [subtropical climate](/wiki/Subtropics "Subtropics") with mild winters and hot, humid summers, allowing for a long growing season. The Chesapeake Bay affects the climate on the Eastern Shore and inland from its cool winds during the warm months. There is a moderate amount of rainfall throughout the year at about 44 inches in coastal Maryland and slightly more down towards Tidewater Virginia.[[23]](#cite_note-23)

#### Climate change

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tidewater_Region&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Climate change")]

The driving impact of climate change in the Tidewater region is the rise in Atlantic sea levels due to melting ice sheets/glaciers and rising water temperatures. According to the [Chesapeake Climate Action Network](/wiki/Chesapeake_Climate_Action_Network "Chesapeake Climate Action Network"), the Atlantic is rising three to four times the pace of the global average and especially fast on Virginia's coast, which has one of the highest rates in the country.[[24]](#cite_note-:10-24)[[25]](#cite_note-:11-25) Norfolk, Virginia has been identified as the most vulnerable city to rising sea levels on the Atlantic Coast, and it is possible that by 2100, the Tidewater region could have up to an 8-foot change in high tides.[[24]](#cite_note-:10-24)

The region has seen growing temperatures and more intense and frequent storms leading to recurrent flooding. Over the last four decades, Virginia has had dozens of [tropical cyclones](/wiki/Tropical_cyclone "Tropical cyclone"), severe storms, and winter storms that each caused more than a billion dollars in damage. Rising sea levels and storms also threaten public health by infiltrating drinking water with saltwater.[[25]](#cite_note-:11-25)

The health of the Chesapeake Bay is also affected by warming water temperatures which increase the amount of *[Vibrio](/wiki/Vibrio "Vibrio")* bacteria and contaminate fish and shellfish. Seagrass and vegetation in the bay that provide habitats for organisms, filter nutrients, and produce [dissolved oxygen](/wiki/Oxygen_saturation "Oxygen saturation") is also affected.[[25]](#cite_note-:11-25)

### Flora and fauna

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tidewater_Region&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Flora and fauna")]

Tidewater is host to plants commonly found in the South Atlantic pine forests and lower southeast coastal areas. The proximity of the Gulf Stream to the region and the presence of fresh and saltwater allows for a diverse ecosystem that supports an abundance of species.[[7]](#cite_note-:0-7)

The region has large white oak, live oak, red cedars, cypress, and longleaf pine trees. In the [Great Dismal Swamp](/wiki/Great_Dismal_Swamp "Great Dismal Swamp") of southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina is a 3,500-year-old cypress-gum forest with cypress, black gum, tupelo gum, and other wetland trees like Atlantic white cedar, red maple, and loblolly pine. Before the cypress gum forest, the swamp was first a pine-spruce forest replaced by a beech-hemlock-birch forest and then an oak-hickory forest. Throughout the Tidewater region are [secondary forests](/wiki/Secondary_forest "Secondary forest") of different types of oak and hardwood species such as beech and yellow poplars as well as pines, loblolly being the most common. The [common reed](/wiki/Phragmites_australis "Phragmites australis") grows rapidly in the wetlands of the region and is considered invasive.[[26]](#cite_note-:13-26)

The most common fish in the region are minnows, shiners, carp, sunfish, largemouth bass, and catfish. Some species are resident while others migrate. Aquatic turtles and water snakes are abundant along with frogs and toads. There are fewer amphibians in the area because of the abundance of fish that eat their eggs.[[27]](#cite_note-:15-27) The [American alligator](/wiki/American_alligator "American alligator") has inhabited the region, specifically parts of North Carolina since prehistory. The largest amounts of alligators in the region today are found on the eastern side of the Alligator River by the Albemarle Sound.[[7]](#cite_note-:0-7) Many of the birds in the region are referred to as [waterfowl](/wiki/Anseriformes "Anseriformes"), which migrate to the region in the winter, such as geese, swans, and ducks.[[7]](#cite_note-:0-7) The mallard and wood duck breed in the region most commonly. Raptors like osprey, bald eagles, and northern harriers feed on smaller birds and fish. There is a high abundance of bird species because of a variety of microhabitats within the region. For example, dead common reed and cattail plants offer shelter to birds like marsh wren, sparrows, and blackbirds. Songbirds and woodpeckers forage and nest in shrubs and trees in higher elevations, and raptors perch and nest in tall dead trees.[[27]](#cite_note-:15-27) Mammals include the white-tailed deer, skunks, black bears, foxes, rabbits, raccoons, star-nosed moles, beavers, and river otters.[[27]](#cite_note-:15-27)[[7]](#cite_note-:0-7)

#### Extinct and extirpated species

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Tidewater_Region&action=edit&section=20 "Edit section: Extinct and extirpated species")]

The largest herds of wild horned cattle once lived around the [Albemarle peninsula](/wiki/Albemarle-Pamlico_Peninsula "Albemarle-Pamlico Peninsula") and the Great Dismal Swamp. Bison inhabited the woodlands of Virginia and North Carolina, and a peccary species (similar to hogs) lived in coastal North Carolina. An unnamed canine species also lived in the Albemarle swamps but were [extirpated](/wiki/Local_extinction "Local extinction") by early settlers because they hunted colonial livestock. Extinct species that once inhabited the region include the Carolina parakeet, passenger pigeon, ivory-billed woodpecker, and mammoth.[[7]](#cite_note-:0-7)

## Demographics
