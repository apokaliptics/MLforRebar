Australian writer and spiritual teacher

**Isha Judd** (born 1 May 1962 in [Melbourne](/wiki/Melbourne "Melbourne"), Australia) is a writer and [spiritual teacher](/wiki/Spiritual_teacher "Spiritual teacher") who has gained popularity in [Latin America](/wiki/Latin_America "Latin America").

## Educational Meditation

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Isha_Judd&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Educational Meditation")]

Judd is the creator of a system for [self knowledge](/wiki/Self-knowledge_(psychology) "Self-knowledge (psychology)") and expansion of consciousness called *Educational Meditation*. It is a program based on a [meditation](/wiki/Meditation "Meditation") technique integrated with other complementary practices. It includes a set of self-knowledge educational principles to encourage [self development](/w/index.php?title=Self_development&action=edit&redlink=1 "Self development (page does not exist)") and nurture coexistence. Judd's Educational Foundation brought together a multidisciplinary team of professionals to design a comprehensive program covering all levels of education: [preschool](/wiki/Preschool "Preschool"), [school](/wiki/Primary_school "Primary school"), [university](/wiki/University "University"), and other educational areas such as [health](/wiki/Health "Health"), [psychology](/wiki/Psychology "Psychology"), [psychopedagogy](/wiki/Psychopedagogy "Psychopedagogy"), [arts](/wiki/Arts "Arts"), [communication](/wiki/Communication "Communication"), [human relations](/wiki/Human_relations "Human relations"), [peace culture](/w/index.php?title=Peace_culture&action=edit&redlink=1 "Peace culture (page does not exist)"), [intercultural dialogue](/wiki/Intercultural_dialogue "Intercultural dialogue") and [social cohesion](/wiki/Social_cohesion "Social cohesion"). This educational meditation technique develops universal values such as appreciation, gratitude, love and unity. [*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]

The complementary practices to promote comprehensive health include: experiencing full consciousness or being in the doing, exercise, nutrition and hydration, and the honest and open expression of thoughts and feelings. [*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]

The educational principles of self-knowledge are: happiness, peace and love are an internal experience (introspection development). Emotions are natural so one must feel and manage them properly (emotional learning development). What you focus on grows (value-based education development). The relationship with self is reflected in the relationship with others (development of responsibility). [*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]

This is how the meditation integrated with complementary practices develops the self and coexistence: by leading us to a state of inner peace and incorporating values that generate the experience of a positive behavioral change. From a theoretical and practical point of view, self-knowledge educational principles have the same effect and all the components of Educational Meditation work synergistically. [*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]

Judd works with prisoners and victims of natural disasters through her foundation.[[1]](#cite_note-1) In 2010, following her work in the prisons of Buenos Aires, Judd was named *Ambassador For Peace* in a ceremony at the Argentinean Senate.[[2]](#cite_note-2) In 2012, she received an Honorary Degree from the *Universidad Internacional,* Cuernavaca, Mexico for her "humanitarian efforts and contributing to the betterment of the human condition through personal growth."[[3]](#cite_note-3)

Through her foundation, Judd has taught her system to Mexican soldiers, with the support of the [Morelos State Commission of Human Rights](/w/index.php?title=Morelos_State_Commission_of_Human_Rights&action=edit&redlink=1 "Morelos State Commission of Human Rights (page does not exist)") (CDHM), in order to help prevent human rights violations within the [Mexican Army](/wiki/Mexican_Army "Mexican Army").[[4]](#cite_note-4)

Judd has stated that, following a series of setbacks and personal losses when she was 28, she began a process of inner exploration, leading eventually to a profound spiritual awakening and later the development of her own system for the expansion of consciousness.[[5]](#cite_note-5)

Judd has two international retreat centers, located in [Costa Azul](/wiki/Costa_Azul "Costa Azul"), [Uruguay](/wiki/Uruguay "Uruguay"),[[6]](#cite_note-6) and in [Manzanillo, Mexico](/wiki/Manzanillo,_Colima "Manzanillo, Colima").[[7]](#cite_note-7)
