River in New Zealand

The **Pororari River**, with an older spelling of **Porarari**, is a river of the [West Coast Region](/wiki/West_Coast_Region "West Coast Region") of New Zealand's [South Island](/wiki/South_Island "South Island"). It flows northwest from its sources in the [Paparoa Range](/wiki/Paparoa_Range "Paparoa Range"), reaching the [Tasman Sea](/wiki/Tasman_Sea "Tasman Sea") at [Punakaiki](/wiki/Punakaiki "Punakaiki") via [Pororari Lagoon](/w/index.php?title=Pororari_Lagoon&action=edit&redlink=1 "Pororari Lagoon (page does not exist)"). [Cave Creek / Kotihotiho](/wiki/Cave_Creek_/_Kotihotiho "Cave Creek / Kotihotiho") is a tributary to the river. There are opportunities to [tramp](/wiki/Tramping_in_New_Zealand "Tramping in New Zealand") along this river, with two different options accommodating multi-hour loop walks. Further upstream, the Pororari River is followed by the new [Paparoa Track](/wiki/Paparoa_Track "Paparoa Track"), which provides an opportunity for multi-day tramping or mountain biking.

## Toponymy

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pororari_River&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Toponymy")]

When maps were updated for the region, the clerk of [Buller County](/wiki/Buller_County,_New_Zealand "Buller County, New Zealand") was asked about the correct spelling of the river. His advice was that "Pororari" is the correct spelling, with "Porarari" sometimes having erroneously been used. The [Māori language](/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language "Māori language") name for the river consists of *poro* (meaning "broken off") and *rari* (meaning "uproar"). This is a descriptive term and refers to the upper reaches that are very steep.[[1]](#cite_note-LINZ-1)

## Geography

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pororari_River&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Geography")]

The Pororari River has its source in the [Paparoa Range](/wiki/Paparoa_Range "Paparoa Range") on its western side near [Mount Pecksniff](/w/index.php?title=Mount_Pecksniff&action=edit&redlink=1 "Mount Pecksniff (page does not exist)"), with some tributaries coming from the nearby peak known as [White Knight](/w/index.php?title=White_Knight_(hill)&action=edit&redlink=1 "White Knight (hill) (page does not exist)").[[1]](#cite_note-LINZ-1)

The lower part of the Pororari River flows through the Pororari River gorge, a limestone gorge described by the [Department of Conservation](/wiki/Department_of_Conservation_(New_Zealand) "Department of Conservation (New Zealand)") (DOC) as "spectacular". This part of the river features large rocks and deep pools, with the vegetation transitioning from sub-tropical to temperate.[[2]](#cite_note-PR_tracks_DOC-2)

The one notable tributary is [Cave Creek / Kotihotiho](/wiki/Cave_Creek_/_Kotihotiho "Cave Creek / Kotihotiho"), which flows into the Pororari River from its right.[[3]](#cite_note-3)

The Pororari River flows into [Pororari Lagoon](/w/index.php?title=Pororari_Lagoon&action=edit&redlink=1 "Pororari Lagoon (page does not exist)"), where it is joined by [Bullock Creek](/wiki/Bullock_Creek_(New_Zealand) "Bullock Creek (New Zealand)") before flowing into the [Tasman Sea](/wiki/Tasman_Sea "Tasman Sea").[[4]](#cite_note-4)[[5]](#cite_note-5)

## Tracks

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pororari_River&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Tracks")]

The Pororari River Track starts at the [Paparoa National Park](/wiki/Paparoa_National_Park "Paparoa National Park") Visitor Centre. Walkers walk along [State Highway 6](/wiki/State_Highway_6_(New_Zealand) "State Highway 6 (New Zealand)") (SH6) for 1 km (0.62 mi) and then follow the Pororari River on its true-left through the gorge. Just upstream of the gorge, the track ends and meets the [Inland Pack Track](/wiki/Inland_Pack_Track "Inland Pack Track") that also crosses the Pororari River near this junction. The Pororari River Track is often walked as a loop track, with the Inland Pack Track going south, Waikori Road which runs alongside the [Punakaiki River](/wiki/Punakaiki_River "Punakaiki River") and SH6 completing the loop. DOC suggests to allow three hours for the 11 km (6.8 mi) loop.[[2]](#cite_note-PR_tracks_DOC-2)

Another loop track is formed by walking the Pororari River Track and then walking the Inland Pack Track north, and the back towards the coast via Bullock Creek Road which follows [Bullock Creek](/wiki/Bullock_Creek_(New_Zealand) "Bullock Creek (New Zealand)"). To complete the loop, walkers follow SH6 for 1 km (0.62 mi) back to the visitor centre. This 15 km (9.3 mi) loop should take five to six hours to walk.[[2]](#cite_note-PR_tracks_DOC-2)

The Pororari River is also followed by the new [Paparoa Track](/wiki/Paparoa_Track "Paparoa Track"), the newest [Great Walk](/wiki/New_Zealand_Great_Walks "New Zealand Great Walks").[[6]](#cite_note-track_brochure-6) The Paparoa Track was built as a memorial to the 2010 [Pike River Mine disaster](/wiki/Pike_River_Mine_disaster "Pike River Mine disaster") and can be used by both walkers and mountain bikers. Walkers reach the Pororari River on their third day and descend towards the coast. At the junction with the Inland Pack Track, walkers continue via the Pororari River Track whilst mountain bikers continue towards Waikori Road; biking on the Pororari River Track is not permitted.[[7]](#cite_note-7)
