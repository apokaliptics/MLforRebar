2022–23 concert tour by Lorde

The **Solar Power Tour** was the third concert tour by New Zealand singer-songwriter [Lorde](/wiki/Lorde "Lorde"), in support of her third studio album *[Solar Power](/wiki/Solar_Power_(album) "Solar Power (album)")* (2021). The tour started on April 3, 2022, at the [Grand Ole Opry House](/wiki/Grand_Ole_Opry#Grand_Ole_Opry_House "Grand Ole Opry") in [Nashville](/wiki/Nashville "Nashville"), and concluded on August 19, 2023, at the Praia Fluvial do Taboão in [Paredes de Coura](/wiki/Paredes_de_Coura "Paredes de Coura"), spanning over 70 shows in [North America](/wiki/North_America "North America"), [Europe](/wiki/Europe "Europe"), [Latin America](/wiki/Latin_America "Latin America") and [Oceania](/wiki/Oceania "Oceania").

The show consisted of three segments and an encore, with two or three costume changes. The set list changed frequently as the tour went on, but consistently featured songs from all three of her studio albums, and occasionally included covers.

## Background

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Solar_Power_Tour&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Background")]

The [Primavera Sound](/wiki/Primavera_Sound "Primavera Sound") setlist for their 2022 festival was revealed on 25 May 2021, which included Lorde as a headliner.[[1]](#cite_note-1) The dates for the Solar Power Tour were announced alongside the tracklist and release date of *Solar Power* on 21 June 2021.[[2]](#cite_note-2) Lorde offered [presale](/wiki/Presales "Presales") tickets for her fans subscribed to her mailing list, with presale tickets available from 24 June 2021 in North America and Europe, and 30 June 2021 in Australia and New Zealand. The general sale opened in North America and Europe on 25 June 2021, and in Australia and New Zealand on 5 July 2021.[[3]](#cite_note-3) *[Taranaki Daily News](/wiki/Taranaki_Daily_News "Taranaki Daily News")* reported that prices for her concert in [New Plymouth](/wiki/New_Plymouth "New Plymouth") started from [NZ$](/wiki/New_Zealand_dollar "New Zealand dollar")89.90 plus fees.[[4]](#cite_note-4)

On 24 May 2022, shows for Mexico were added, including Mexico City, Monterrey and Guadalajara. Lorde announced the shows via email with a presale code for fans. A second show for Mexico City was added on June 1, at [Pepsi Center WTC](/wiki/Pepsi_Center_WTC "Pepsi Center WTC"), scheduled for October 11 and 12. The show in Monterrey is part of the Tecate Live Out Festival. Lorde also announced plans to play a different setlist of the tour in the Mexico shows.

On 25 June 2021, after her two London shows sold out instantly, Lorde added two new dates in London, with a third show in the [Roundhouse Theatre](/wiki/Roundhouse_Theatre "Roundhouse Theatre") scheduled for 3 June 2022, and another performance to close out the tour on 28 June 2022 at [Alexandra Palace](/wiki/Alexandra_Palace "Alexandra Palace").[[5]](#cite_note-NMELondon-5) A second show was added in [Šibenik](/wiki/%C5%A0ibenik "Šibenik") on the same day, with *Croatia Week* reporting that tickets for her first show sold out in 3 seconds.[[6]](#cite_note-CroatiaShow-6) Additional shows were also added in Toronto, Boston, New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles.[[7]](#cite_note-NewLordeUSA-7) On 1 July 2021, two additional shows were added in Australia, after "overwhelming demand", with one show each added in [Melbourne](/wiki/Melbourne "Melbourne") and [Sydney](/wiki/Sydney "Sydney").[[8]](#cite_note-NewAusShows-8)

It was announced on 10 November 2021 that the Australasian leg of the Solar Power Tour would be postponed to 2023. Lorde said of the decision that "touring internationally through a Covid outbreak has a ton of unforeseen moving parts, and I'd much rather play for you when we're all confident it will go smoothly", and promoters [Frontier Touring](/wiki/Frontier_Touring_Company "Frontier Touring Company") said that the tour was initially scheduled with the expectation that there would be no restrictions on quarantine and that the borders of Australia and New Zealand would be open to non-citizens. New shows in Lower Hutt, Brisbane, and Perth were also announced.[[9]](#cite_note-AusNZPostponed-9)[[10]](#cite_note-10)
