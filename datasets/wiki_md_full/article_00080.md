Philosophical thinking inspired by a particular religion






**Religious philosophy** is philosophical thinking that is influenced and directed as a consequence of teachings from a particular [religion](/wiki/Religion "Religion"). It can be done objectively, but it may also be done as a persuasion tool by believers in that [faith](/wiki/Faith "Faith"). Religious [philosophy](/wiki/Philosophy "Philosophy") is concerned with the nature of religion, [theories of salvation](/wiki/Soteriology "Soteriology"), and [conceptions of god](/wiki/Conceptions_of_God "Conceptions of God"), gods, and/or the divine.[[1]](#cite_note-:0-1)

Due to the historical development of religions, many religions share commonalities concerning their philosophies. These philosophies are often considered to be universal and include beliefs about concepts such as the [afterlife](/wiki/Afterlife "Afterlife"), [souls](/wiki/Soul "Soul"), and [miracles](/wiki/Miracle "Miracle").[[2]](#cite_note-:5-2)

## Philosophical commonalities

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Religious_philosophy&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Philosophical commonalities")]

Religious faith and philosophical reflection are connected to one another. Religious tradition influences the philosophical thinking and beliefs of followers of that religion.[[3]](#cite_note-3)

Many philosophical commonalities have arisen among religions due to their core historical foundations. For example, [Abrahamic religions](/wiki/Abrahamic_religions "Abrahamic religions"), which encompass [Judaism](/wiki/Judaism "Judaism"), [Christianity](/wiki/Christianity "Christianity"), [Islam](/wiki/Islam "Islam"), [Baha'i Faith](/wiki/Bah%C3%A1%CA%BC%C3%AD_Faith "Baháʼí Faith"), [Yezidi](/wiki/Yazidis "Yazidis"), [Druze](/wiki/Druze "Druze"), [Samaritan](/wiki/Samaritans "Samaritans"), and [Rastafari](/wiki/Rastafari "Rastafari"), share philosophical commonalities, although they differ in their presentation of these philosophical concepts through their respective [religious texts](/wiki/Religious_text "Religious text").[[4]](#cite_note-4)[[5]](#cite_note-5)

There are also philosophical concepts and reasoning in religious teachings that were conceived independently from one another but are still similar and reflect analogous ideas.[[6]](#cite_note-:6-6) For example, the arguments and reasoning for the existence of an omniscient [god](/wiki/God "God") or multiple gods can be found in several religions, including Christianity, Islam, and Hinduism. Another example includes the philosophical concept of [free will](/wiki/Free_will "Free will"), which is present in both [monotheistic](/wiki/Monotheism "Monotheism") and [polytheistic](/wiki/Polytheism "Polytheism") religions.[[6]](#cite_note-:6-6)

## Types

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Religious_philosophy&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Types")]

### Intuitive religious philosophy

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Religious_philosophy&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Intuitive religious philosophy")]

Many religious concepts are considered to be "cross-culturally ubiquitous"[[2]](#cite_note-:5-2) as they are "cognitively natural."[[7]](#cite_note-7)[[2]](#cite_note-:5-2) They are deemed intuitive, meaning that they arise without much direction, instruction, or coaching in the early stages of our intellectual development[[8]](#cite_note-:7-8) and do not necessarily originate from cultural influence.[[9]](#cite_note-9) Such religious concepts include beliefs concerning the "afterlife, souls, [supernatural](/wiki/Supernatural "Supernatural") agents, and miraculous events."[[2]](#cite_note-:5-2)

### Reflective religious philosophy

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Religious_philosophy&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Reflective religious philosophy")]

Some religious concepts require deliberate teaching to ensure the transmission of their ideas and beliefs to others.[[8]](#cite_note-:7-8) These beliefs are categorised as reflective and are often stored in a linguistic format that allows for ease of transmission. Reflective philosophies are thought to contribute significantly to the continuation of cultural and religious beliefs.[[10]](#cite_note-10) Such religious philosophies include [karma](/wiki/Karma "Karma"), divine immanent justice, or providence, and also encompass theological concepts such as [Trinity](/wiki/Trinity "Trinity") in Christianity or [Brahman](/wiki/Brahman "Brahman") in Hinduism.[[8]](#cite_note-:7-8)

## God

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Religious_philosophy&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: God")]

Religious philosophy is predominantly concerned with the conceptions of god, gods, and/or the divine.[[1]](#cite_note-:0-1)

### Ontological arguments

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Religious_philosophy&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Ontological arguments")]

Ontological arguments are arguments based on reason with the conclusion that God exists.[[11]](#cite_note-:8-11) There are many notable contributors to the development of various ontological arguments.

In the 11th century C.E., [Saint Anselm of Canterbury](/wiki/Anselm_of_Canterbury "Anselm of Canterbury") (1033–1109) reasoned in his work *[Proslogion](/wiki/Proslogion "Proslogion")* about the existence of God in an ontological argument based on the idea that there is a 'being than which no greater can be conceived'.[[11]](#cite_note-:8-11)[[1]](#cite_note-:0-1)[[12]](#cite_note-12)

[Thomas Aquinas](/wiki/Thomas_Aquinas "Thomas Aquinas") (c. 1225–1274) extracted components of philosophical teaching relevant to Christianity, using philosophy as a means to demonstrate God's existence.[[13]](#cite_note-13) In his work *[Summa Theologica](/wiki/Summa_Theologica "Summa Theologica")*, Aquinas presents five arguments for the existence of God, known as '[quinque viae](/wiki/Five_Ways_(Aquinas) "Five Ways (Aquinas)")' or 'five ways'.[[14]](#cite_note-14)

In the 17th century, [René Descartes](/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes") (1596–1650) proposed similar arguments to those of Saint Anselm of Canterbury. For example, in his work *[Fifth Meditation](/wiki/Meditations_on_First_Philosophy "Meditations on First Philosophy")*, he provides an ontological argument based on the reasoning that if we are able to conceive the idea of a supremely perfect being (i.e., that we have an idea of a supremely perfect being), then, he claims, we are able to reach the conclusion that there exists a supremely perfect being.[[11]](#cite_note-:8-11)[[15]](#cite_note-:9-15)[[16]](#cite_note-:10-16)[[17]](#cite_note-:11-17) Two versions of Descartes' ontological argument exist:[[15]](#cite_note-:9-15)[[16]](#cite_note-:10-16)[[17]](#cite_note-:11-17)

* Version A:

1. Whatever I clearly and distinctly perceive to be contained in the idea of something is true of that thing.
2. I clearly and distinctly perceive that necessary existence is contained in the idea of God.
3. Therefore, God exists.

* Version B:

1. I have an idea of a supremely perfect being, i.e. a being having all perfections.
2. Necessary existence is perfection.
3. Therefore, a supremely perfect being exists.

In the 18th century, [Gottfried Leibniz](/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz "Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz") (1646–1716) further developed Descartes ontological argument by attempting to satisfy a shortcoming in Descartes' proposal, which did not address the coherence of a supremely perfect being. Leibniz reasoned that perfections are compatible as they are unable to be analysed, and therefore are able to exist in a single entity, thereby validating Descartes argument.[[11]](#cite_note-:8-11)

More recently, individuals such as [Kurt Gödel](/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del "Kurt Gödel"), [Charles Hartshorne](/wiki/Charles_Hartshorne "Charles Hartshorne"), [Norman Malcolm](/wiki/Norman_Malcolm "Norman Malcolm"), and [Alvin Plantinga](/wiki/Alvin_Plantinga "Alvin Plantinga") have proposed ontological arguments, many of which elaborate on or are connected to older ontological arguments presented by individuals such as St. Anselm, Descartes, and Leibniz.[[11]](#cite_note-:8-11) For example, Kurt Godel (1905–1978) used modal logic to elaborate and clarify Leibniz's version of Saint Anselm of Canterbury's ontological proof of the existence of God, known as [Godel's Ontological Proof](/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_ontological_proof "Gödel's ontological proof").[[18]](#cite_note-18)

### Concept of God

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Religious_philosophy&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Concept of God")]

An individual's perception of the concept of God influences their [coping](/wiki/Coping "Coping") style.[[19]](#cite_note-:12-19) There are four main religiously affiliated coping mechanisms, as follows:

1. Self-directing style: the individual does not involve God directly and instead individually adopts a problem-solving method.[[19]](#cite_note-:12-19)[[20]](#cite_note-:13-20)
2. Deferring style: the individual submits their issue and the required problem-solving to God.[[19]](#cite_note-:12-19)[[20]](#cite_note-:13-20)
3. Collaborative style: both the individual and God are involved in the problem-solving process.[[19]](#cite_note-:12-19)[[20]](#cite_note-:13-20)
4. Surrender style: the individual works collaboratively with God in the problem-solving process but values God's direction above their own.[[19]](#cite_note-:12-19)[[21]](#cite_note-21)

## Bioethics

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Religious_philosophy&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Bioethics")]

### Medical care

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Religious_philosophy&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: Medical care")]

An individual's religious philosophy is important in the consideration of their medical care and medical decisions, and taking that into account improves the quality of their medical treatment.[[22]](#cite_note-:1-22) Particularly in the case of [palliative care](/wiki/Palliative_care "Palliative care"), understanding different religious philosophical foundations allows for the proper spiritual care to be obtained by the patient.[[23]](#cite_note-23) Religious philosophy is also a necessary consideration in the [psychotherapeutic](/wiki/Psychotherapy "Psychotherapy") treatment of [psychiatric disorders](/wiki/Mental_disorder "Mental disorder").[[24]](#cite_note-24) Consideration of [organ donation](/wiki/Organ_donation "Organ donation") post-death is related to an individual's religious philosophy.[[25]](#cite_note-:2-25)

### Diet

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Religious_philosophy&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: Diet")]

Many religions follow dietary habits. For example, a [vegetarian](/wiki/Vegetarianism "Vegetarianism") diet is adhered to by individuals who follow Buddhism, Hinduism, Seventh-day Adventist.[[22]](#cite_note-:1-22)[[26]](#cite_note-26)[[27]](#cite_note-:19-27) The emphasis on sanctity of all life in the ethical doctrine known as *[ahimsa](/wiki/Ahimsa "Ahimsa")* (non-injury to living beings) in Buddhist and Hindu philosophies encompass human as well as animal life, and influence this vegetarian tradition, with modern influence including the concept of [reincarnation](/wiki/Reincarnation "Reincarnation").[[27]](#cite_note-:19-27)

[Fasting](/wiki/Fasting "Fasting") of various forms (exclusion of specific foods or food groups, or exclusion of food for certain periods of time) are undertaken by individuals who follow philosophies of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Eastern Orthodox, Islam, Roman Catholicism.[[22]](#cite_note-:1-22)

Some religions require for food to be invoked in God's name.[[22]](#cite_note-:1-22)[[28]](#cite_note-:20-28) For example, in Islam, meat must be from properly slaughtered 'clean' animals, known as *[halal](/wiki/Halal "Halal")*, although it is forbidden to consume [scavenger](/wiki/Scavenger "Scavenger") animals.[[27]](#cite_note-:19-27)[[28]](#cite_note-:20-28) The religious philosophical purpose behind Islamic dietary laws derived from the commandments of [Allah](/wiki/Allah "Allah") (Quran and [Sunnah](/wiki/Sunnah "Sunnah") of Muhammad) is the concept of purity, where Muslims consume what is considered pure and clean to be pure both in a physical and spiritual sense.[[28]](#cite_note-:20-28)[[29]](#cite_note-:21-29) Another example includes Jewish [Kosher](/wiki/Kosher_foods "Kosher foods") laws, where individuals must observe kosher food laws derived from [Torah](/wiki/Torah "Torah") and [Mishnah](/wiki/Mishnah "Mishnah") religious scripture texts.[[28]](#cite_note-:20-28)[[29]](#cite_note-:21-29)

### Euthanasia

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Religious_philosophy&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Euthanasia")]

Consideration of euthanasia is influenced by an individual's religious philosophy. Much of the opposition towards legislation of euthanasia is due to religious beliefs.[[30]](#cite_note-30)[[31]](#cite_note-31)[[32]](#cite_note-32)[[33]](#cite_note-33) Individuals who express a belief in God as an entity who controls [destiny](/wiki/Destiny "Destiny") were more opposed to legalisation of euthanasia and physician [assisted suicide](/wiki/Assisted_suicide "Assisted suicide").[[34]](#cite_note-34)[[35]](#cite_note-35) For example, religions such as Christian Science, Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Hinduism, Islam, Jehovah's Witness, Seventh-day Adventist generally do not allow for or practice euthanasia.[[22]](#cite_note-:1-22)[[36]](#cite_note-36)

### Abortion

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Religious_philosophy&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Abortion")]

Many religions hold philosophical value toward life of all forms and are thus completely against abortion.[[37]](#cite_note-37) However abortion is tolerated in specific cases, such as rape or when the mother's life is in danger.[[22]](#cite_note-:1-22)

## Religions

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Religious_philosophy&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: Religions")]

Religious philosophy influences many aspects of an individual's conception and outlook on life. For example, empirical studies concentrating on the philosophical concept of [spirituality](/wiki/Spirituality "Spirituality") at or near the end of life, conducted in India, found that individuals who follow Indian philosophical concepts are influenced by these concepts in their 'perception of spirituality'.[[38]](#cite_note-38)

Considerations concerning [medical care](/wiki/Health_care "Health care"), [death](/wiki/Death "Death"), diet, and [pregnancy](/wiki/Pregnancy "Pregnancy") differ among followers of various religions due to their respective philosophies.[[22]](#cite_note-:1-22)[[39]](#cite_note-39)

### Islamic philosophy

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Religious_philosophy&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Islamic philosophy")]

Islamic philosophies forbid the violation of the human body,[[40]](#cite_note-:4-40) however simultaneously place importance on selflessness;

> And whoever saves one - it is as if he had saved mankind entirely. ([Quran](/wiki/Quran "Quran") 5:32)

Organ donation is generally endorsed,[[22]](#cite_note-:1-22) through the principle that necessity overrides prohibition known as *al-darurat tubih al-mahzurat.*[[40]](#cite_note-:4-40)[[41]](#cite_note-:14-41) Objections to organ donation in Islamic religion is mainly originated on cultural foundations rather than religious philosophical ones, with their altruistic principle allowing for exceptions in regard to medical intervention, for example; involving porcine [bone grafts](/wiki/Bone_grafting "Bone grafting") and pork [insulin](/wiki/Insulin_(medication) "Insulin (medication)").[[40]](#cite_note-:4-40)[[42]](#cite_note-42) Formal decisions have been made regarding organ donation in association with Islamic teachings, for example, the UK Muslim Law Council in 1996 issued a *[Ijtihad](/wiki/Ijtihad "Ijtihad")* (religious ruling) that defined organ transplantation within the scope of the Islamic following, and Islamic Jurisprudence Assembly Council in [Saudi Arabia](/wiki/Saudi_Arabia "Saudi Arabia") in 1988 approving organ donation, with similar formal decisions made in [Egypt](/wiki/Egypt "Egypt"), [Iran](/wiki/Iran "Iran"), and [Pakistan](/wiki/Pakistan "Pakistan").[[43]](#cite_note-43)

Islamic jurisprudence does not condone or allow for an individual to die voluntarily.[[44]](#cite_note-:22-44)[[45]](#cite_note-:23-45) Islamic philosophies indicate that life is a divine, sacred gift, with Allah deciding how long each individual will live.[[46]](#cite_note-:24-46)[[45]](#cite_note-:23-45) The moment of death, known as *ajal*, cannot be hastened by any form of passive or active voluntary intervention (e.g. in the form of euthanasia) as this is completely under the control of Allah.[[46]](#cite_note-:24-46)[[47]](#cite_note-:25-47) Only Allah has the absolute authority and ability to give life as well as take it away.[[47]](#cite_note-:25-47)[[45]](#cite_note-:23-45) Islamic philosophies emphasise that life does not belong to the human, but to Allah.[[46]](#cite_note-:24-46) Although the Qur'an states "Nor take life – which Allah has made sacred – except for just cause" (Quran 17:33), *[hadith](/wiki/Hadith "Hadith")* literature indicates that despite intolerable pain and suffering, euthanasia is not condoned.[[44]](#cite_note-:22-44) For example, according to *[Sahih Muslim](/wiki/Sahih_Muslim "Sahih Muslim"),* in the [Battle of Hunayn](/wiki/Battle_of_Hunayn "Battle of Hunayn") a Muslim warrior committed [suicide](/wiki/Suicide "Suicide") due to the pain of his wound however Muhammad declared that this act negated his courage and service to God and doomed him to Hell.[[44]](#cite_note-:22-44)

### Christian philosophy

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Religious_philosophy&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Christian philosophy")]

Christian philosophies generally endorse organ donation although reasoning and opinion differ amongst sects.[[22]](#cite_note-:1-22)[[25]](#cite_note-:2-25) Christian theologians reference the [Bible](/wiki/Bible "Bible")[[48]](#cite_note-:3-48) in regard to organ donation, particularly;

> Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out devils: Freely you have received, freely give. (Matthew 10:8)[[49]](#cite_note-49)
> Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. (John 15:13)[[50]](#cite_note-50)

Most Christian scholar sanction organ transplantation as it is deemed an act of selflessness, with the [Catholic](/wiki/Catholic_Church "Catholic Church") and [Protestant Church](/wiki/Protestantism "Protestantism") endorsing organ donation in a joint declaration in 1990, promoting the action as an act of Christian love.[[40]](#cite_note-:4-40)[[41]](#cite_note-:14-41)

### Jewish philosophy

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Religious_philosophy&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Jewish philosophy")]

Jewish philosophies hold great importance on the intact burial of the deceased persons due to *[halakhic](/wiki/Halakha "Halakha")* foundations.[[51]](#cite_note-51) However, much like Islam, [altruism](/wiki/Altruism "Altruism") in the form of saving a life, known as *[pikuach nefesh](/wiki/Pikuach_nefesh "Pikuach nefesh")* in Jewish law, overrides all other commandments and prohibition;[[52]](#cite_note-:15-52)

> Whoever destroys a soul, it is considered as if he destroyed an entire world. And whoever saves a life, it is considered as if he saved an entire world. (Babylonian [Talmud](/wiki/Talmud "Talmud"), tractate Sanhedrin 37a)

[Organ donation](/wiki/Organ_donation_in_Jewish_law "Organ donation in Jewish law") is endorsed by most Jewish scholars.[[22]](#cite_note-:1-22)[[52]](#cite_note-:15-52)

Jewish philosophies in Rabbinical works [generally condemn abortion](/wiki/Judaism_and_abortion "Judaism and abortion"), [foeticide](/wiki/Foeticide "Foeticide"), or [infanticide](/wiki/Infanticide "Infanticide") as it is viewed as an immoral action on human life.[[53]](#cite_note-:16-53)[[54]](#cite_note-:17-54) However, 'abortion appears as an option for Jewish women from the earliest sources of the Bible and Mishnaic commentary',[[55]](#cite_note-:18-55)[[56]](#cite_note-56) where the Talmud indicates that a mother's life is prioritised if her life or wellbeing is put at risk by the child, thereby permitting abortion.[[54]](#cite_note-:17-54) Jewish laws do not condone abortion in scenarios involving [rape](/wiki/Rape "Rape") or [incest](/wiki/Incest "Incest").[[54]](#cite_note-:17-54)

### Hindu philosophy

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Religious_philosophy&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: Hindu philosophy")]

Hindu philosophies prohibit abortion, in line with *[dharmasastras](/wiki/Dharma%C5%9B%C4%81stra "Dharmaśāstra")*. Hindu philosophy regarding conception involve the belief that both physical and spiritual qualities, like an individual's past karma, exist and enter the human [embryo](/wiki/Embryo "Embryo") from the moment of conception.[[53]](#cite_note-:16-53)

### Buddhist philosophy

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Religious_philosophy&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Buddhist philosophy")]

In Buddhist philosophies, much like Hindu philosophies, there is a morally negative view towards abortion[[57]](#cite_note-57) in accordance to the [Five Precepts](/wiki/Five_precepts "Five precepts").[[53]](#cite_note-:16-53) However, the intention behind an action is an important consideration,[[58]](#cite_note-58)[[59]](#cite_note-59) and therefore many Buddhists accept the idea of abortion if under the pretence of good intention.[[60]](#cite_note-60)

### Taoist philosophy

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Religious_philosophy&action=edit&section=19 "Edit section: Taoist philosophy")]

Taoist philosophy expresses a desire to find and maintain a balance between populations and their resources.[[55]](#cite_note-:18-55) Therefore, due to these philosophies, population management were of national interests observed in China's ['one child' policy](/wiki/One-child_policy "One-child policy").[[55]](#cite_note-:18-55)[[61]](#cite_note-61) However, abortion is not encouraged as it would 'corrupt the body and would wrongly negate the body's capacity to give life'.[[62]](#cite_note-62)
