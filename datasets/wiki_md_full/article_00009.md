Nicolle was awarded the [Centenary Medal](/wiki/Centenary_Medal "Centenary Medal") in 2001[[5]](#cite_note-5) and the Medal of the Order of Australia in the [2018 Queen's Birthday Honours](/wiki/2018_Queen%27s_Birthday_Honours_(Australia) "2018 Queen's Birthday Honours (Australia)") for "service to the conservation of Australian eucalypts".[[6]](#cite_note-6)

In August 2025, the 4.4-kilometre (2.7 mi) Dean Nicolle Eucalypt Walk was opened along a section of the old railway corridor at [Blyth, South Australia](/wiki/Blyth,_South_Australia "Blyth, South Australia"). The walk is the brainchild of artist [Ian Roberts](/wiki/Ian_Roberts_(painter) "Ian Roberts (painter)"), who named it after Nicolle, following a long partnership whereby Roberts painted watercolours of eucalypts that he grew from seeds provided by Nicolle. As of September 2025, Roberts had painted around 770 of the 900 species of eucalypts. The trail features more than 2,000 Australian plant species, including 300 varieties of rare eucalypt, planted by volunteers between 2010 and 2019.[[7]](#cite_note-7)
