Historic church in Minnesota, United States

United States historic place

**Laketown Moravian Brethren's Church** (also known as **Lake Auburn Moravian Church**) is a historic church on County Highway 11 in [Victoria, Minnesota](/wiki/Victoria,_Minnesota "Victoria, Minnesota"), United States.

The congregation was organized on October 31, 1858, at the house of John Holtmeier. In 1860 a log church was built on land that Holtmeier donated to the congregation. In 1878, a brick church was built near the previous site, at a cost of $2500, with 74 members in the congregation.[[2]](#cite_note-2)

The church was added to the [National Register of Historic Places](/wiki/National_Register_of_Historic_Places "National Register of Historic Places") in 1980. It was nominated for being a well-preserved example of rural vernacular religious architecture, marking a transition between the spartan frame designs of Carver County's earliest churches and its elaborate later churches of brick.[[3]](#cite_note-3)
