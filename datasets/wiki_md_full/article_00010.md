## Biography

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Harry_Watts_(jockey)&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Biography")]

Watts was born in 1894 in [Toronto](/wiki/Toronto "Toronto"). On May 22, 1915, at [Woodbine Racetrack](/wiki/Woodbine_Racetrack "Woodbine Racetrack"), Watts rode Tartarean to victory for the King's Plate, finishing in 2:09.20.[[2]](#cite_note-2) Watts' brother, Richard, was also a professional thoroughbred jockey. After a successful career as a jockey, Watts retired from the sport, and became a [butcher](/wiki/Butcher "Butcher"). He married Myrtle E McEwan, and together they had three children. The family owned a longstanding butcher shop in Toronto's East York until Watts' death in 1940, in Toronto.[[3]](#cite_note-3)[[4]](#cite_note-4) He is buried in Toronto's historic St John Norway's Church Cemetery.

## Tartarean

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Harry_Watts_(jockey)&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Tartarean")]

Tartarean is described as following in Louis E. Cauz's "The Plate, A Royal Tradition":

> Tartarean was a bay colt by Stanhope II, a grandson of [St. Simon](/wiki/St._Simon_(horse) "St. Simon (horse)"), from Tarletan by Uhlan. He was bred by the Pontiac Stud owned by [Lily A. Livingston](/w/index.php?title=Lily_A._Livingston&action=edit&redlink=1 "Lily A. Livingston (page does not exist)"), owned by [Charles Millar](/wiki/Charles_Vance_Millar "Charles Vance Millar"), trained by Jonn Nixon, and ridden by Harry Watts. Charles Millar came to own Tartarean and stablemate Fair Montague, who finished second, because of a rule at the time which dictated that horse owners in [Ontario](/wiki/Ontario "Ontario") not only had to be residents but had to be British subjects. Mrs. Livingston, the breeder of both runners, was an American citizen. She did receive $500 from the OJC as the breeder of the winner though.[[5]](#cite_note-5)

## May 22, 1915: The King's Plate race

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Harry_Watts_(jockey)&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: May 22, 1915: The King's Plate race")]

Watts, trainer Nixon, and Tartaren's owner Millar were all Toronto citizens, racing in their home town for the country's most prestigious horse racing trophy. Their victory was celebrated as a victory for the city of Toronto.[[6]](#cite_note-query.nytimes-6)

A special segment titled "King's Plate For Toronto" appearing in the [New York Times](/wiki/New_York_Times "New York Times") on May 22, 1915, described the "classic event", and surrounding excitement, as follows:

> The King's Plate of 1915, which will go down into Canadian turf history as one of the best contested events in many years, was a thorough Toronto victory. [...] Wagering on the plate was unusually heavy, the heaviest, in fact, for years if the crush and turmoil around the machines was any indication.[[6]](#cite_note-query.nytimes-6)

Race favourte, Lady Curzon, was a fourth-place finisher, out performed by Pepper Sauce in third, Fair Montague in second, and Tartaren in first. While Fair Montague maintained a lead for most of the race, she "could not stall off the irresistible challenger of Tartarean, which captured the honours in the final stride."[[6]](#cite_note-query.nytimes-6)

Tartarean's performance during the King's cup race was described as following by Louis E. Cauz:

> His time for the 10 furlongs on a good track was 2:09.1, five seconds off the track record. "Tartarean followed the leaders until the far turn, then moved up steadily and, finishing fast, outstayed Fair Montague in a close finish." He won by a neck with four lengths separating second and third positions.
