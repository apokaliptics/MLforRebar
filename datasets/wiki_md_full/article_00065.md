South African singer and songwriter



Musical artist

**Francois Henning** (born 22 December 1974), better known by his [stage name](/wiki/Stage_name "Stage name") **Snotkop** ([[ˈsnɔtkɔp]](/wiki/Help:IPA/Afrikaans "Help:IPA/Afrikaans"), and previously known as **Lekgoa** [[ləkˈχo̯a]](/wiki/Help:IPA/Afrikaans "Help:IPA/Afrikaans"), is a South African singer and rapper who performs in [Afrikaans](/wiki/Afrikaans "Afrikaans").

He started his music career at age 15 preparing demo CDs,[[1]](#cite_note-1) and in the late 1990s adopted the stage name Lekgoa ("white guy" in [Sotho language Sotho](/w/index.php?title=Sotho_language_Sotho&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sotho language Sotho (page does not exist)")) singing in the South African [kwaito](/wiki/Kwaito "Kwaito") genre of music. In this period, he was signed to Gallo record label, releasing two albums; *Basetsana* in 1999 and *Ngamla Yoba* in 2002.

In 2005, he adopted the name Snotkop initially as part of a 4-piece boy band, and shortly later a solo act signing with Next Music-record label, and launched his self-titled 2005 debut album *Snotkop* followed by *So Damn Sexy* in 2008 and *Francois Henning was hier* in 2009. With the release of *Ek laaik van jol* in 2012, he became one of the top selling South African artists in Africa in the Afrikaans language. Well known singles and music video releases include "Song vir my dad", "Dis 'n land", "Hou my stywer vas", "Oppas", "Katrien", "Parapapa" (a remake of [Cidinho & Doca](/wiki/Cidinho_%26_Doca "Cidinho & Doca") hit "[Rap das Armas](/wiki/Rap_das_Armas "Rap das Armas")"), "Hoe lykit", "Raak vir my rustig", "Cool soos Koos Kombuis", and "Agter op my fiets". He is also featured in [Shine4](/wiki/Shine4 "Shine4")'s "Ramaja", a cover of [Glenys Lynne](/w/index.php?title=Glenys_Lynne&action=edit&redlink=1 "Glenys Lynne (page does not exist)")'s hit with the same title, in [Kurt Darren](/wiki/Kurt_Darren "Kurt Darren")'s hit "Stoomtrein" and in MoniQue's hit "Ek val vir jou", an Afrikaans cover of [Waldo's People](/wiki/Waldo%27s_People "Waldo's People")'s "[Lose Control](/wiki/Lose_Control_(Waldo%27s_People_song) "Lose Control (Waldo's People song)")", one of several international hits he has covered in the language. Other covers include [The Offspring](/wiki/The_Offspring "The Offspring")'s "[Why Don't You Get A Job?](/wiki/Why_Don%27t_You_Get_A_Job%3F "Why Don't You Get A Job?")", covered as "Kry jouself by die werk" and Junior e Leonardo's "[Rap das Armas](/wiki/Rap_das_Armas "Rap das Armas")", covered as "Parapapa", but with unrelated lyrics.

Snotkop is also a television personality. He presented the programme *Petrolkop* on [MK](/wiki/MK_(channel) "MK (channel)"), the mostly Afrikaans music channel in South Africa where Snotkop featured various celebrities driving racing cars in time trials against each other.
