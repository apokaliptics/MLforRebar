## History

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=InterSystems&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

InterSystems was founded in 1978 by [Phillip T. (Terry) Ragon](/wiki/Phillip_Ragon "Phillip Ragon"), its current CEO.[[5]](#cite_note-5) The firm was one of the vendors of M-technology (aka [MUMPS](/wiki/MUMPS "MUMPS")) systems, with a product called ISM-11 (an DSM-11 clone) for the DEC PDP-11 .[[6]](#cite_note-:1-6) Over the years, it acquired several other MUMPS implementations: DTM from Data Tree (1993); DSM from [Digital](/wiki/Digital_Equipment_Corporation "Digital Equipment Corporation") (1995);[[7]](#cite_note-7) and MSM from Micronetics (1998); making InterSystems the dominant M technology vendor.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]

The firm eventually started combining features from these products into one they called OpenM, then consolidated the technologies into a product, Caché, in 1997.[[8]](#cite_note-:2-8) Caché offered several new important features, not available in MUMPS offerings, including support for web, object-oriented development and SQL access to the database. At that time they stopped new development for all of their legacy M-based products (although the company still supports existing customers). They launched Ensemble, an integration platform, in 2003[[9]](#cite_note-9) and [HealthShare](/wiki/HealthShare "HealthShare"), a scalable [health informatics](/wiki/Health_informatics "Health informatics") platform, in 2006.[[10]](#cite_note-10) In 2007, InterSystems purchased TrakHealth,[[8]](#cite_note-:2-8) an [Australian](/wiki/Australia "Australia") vendor of TrakCare, a modular healthcare information system based on InterSystems technology. In May 2011, the firm launched Globals as a free database based on the [multi-dimensional array](/wiki/Multi-dimensional_array "Multi-dimensional array") storage technology used in Caché.[[11]](#cite_note-11) In September 2011, InterSystems purchased Siemens Health Services (SHS) France from its parent company, [Siemens](/wiki/Siemens "Siemens").[[12]](#cite_note-12) In September 2017, InterSystems announced InterSystems IRIS Data Platform, which, the company said, combines database management capabilities together with interoperability and analytics, as well as technologies such as [sharding](/wiki/Shard_(database_architecture) "Shard (database architecture)") for performance.[[13]](#cite_note-13)

## Microsoft dispute

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=InterSystems&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Microsoft dispute")]

On August 14, 2008, the [Boston Globe](/wiki/Boston_Globe "Boston Globe") reported that InterSystems was filing a lawsuit against [Microsoft Corporation](/wiki/Microsoft_Corporation "Microsoft Corporation"), another tenant in its Cambridge, Mass., headquarters, seeking to prevent Microsoft from expanding in the building. InterSystems also filed a lawsuit against building owner Equity Office Partners, a subsidiary of the Blackstone Group, "contending that it conspired with Microsoft to lease space that InterSystems had rights to, and sought to drive up rents in the process".[[14]](#cite_note-14)

In 2010, CEO Terry Ragon led a coalition in Cambridge called Save Our Skyline to protest a city zoning change that would have allowed more signs on top of commercial buildings, partly in response to Microsoft's desire to put a sign on top of their shared building.[[15]](#cite_note-15)

Both disputes were eventually settled, and Microsoft and InterSystems agreed to both put low signs only in front of the building at street level.
