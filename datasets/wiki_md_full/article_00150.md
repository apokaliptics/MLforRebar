## History

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Riverside_Yacht_Club&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: History")]

The Riverside Yacht Club was founded in 1888 by George I. Tyson, a prominent and wealthy summer resident of Riverside, CT, and the owner of the yacht *Nirvana*.[[2]](#cite_note-:0-2)[[3]](#cite_note-:2-3) Using his own money and waterfront property, Tyson built the original [Victorian-style](/wiki/Victorian_architecture "Victorian architecture") clubhouse in 1889 on the eastern shore of [Cos Cob](/wiki/Cos_Cob "Cos Cob") Harbor near the entrance of the [Mianus River](/wiki/Mianus_River "Mianus River").[[2]](#cite_note-:0-2)[[4]](#cite_note-:1-4) Tyson became the first Commodore, a post he held for eight years.[[2]](#cite_note-:0-2)

The original clubhouse contained a kitchen, ballroom, reading rooms, card rooms, bedrooms, locker rooms, and an expansive wrap-around porch.[[4]](#cite_note-:1-4) In 1893, a new addition was constructed, containing a [billiard](/wiki/Cue_sports "Cue sports") room, [shuffleboard](/wiki/Shuffleboard "Shuffleboard") area, [bowling](/wiki/Bowling "Bowling") area, staff housing, and horse sheds.[[4]](#cite_note-:1-4)

For a short period during the early 1890s, the club met in winter quarters in New York City, and by the late 1920s, the club membership had purchased the property from the Tyson estate.[[2]](#cite_note-:0-2) In 1929, construction of the current clubhouse was completed.[[2]](#cite_note-:0-2)

On September 21, 1938, the [1938 New England hurricane](/wiki/1938_New_England_hurricane "1938 New England hurricane") caused the main and junior clubhouses to flood, with no damage to sailing vessels.[[4]](#cite_note-:1-4) Some vessels, but not the clubhouse, were damaged as a result of the [1944 Great Atlantic hurricane](/wiki/1944_Great_Atlantic_hurricane "1944 Great Atlantic hurricane").[[4]](#cite_note-:1-4)

In 1978 and 2013, the clubhouse underwent major renovations.[[3]](#cite_note-:2-3)[[5]](#cite_note-5)
