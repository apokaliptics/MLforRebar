Species of tree

***Carpodetus serratus*** is an [evergreen](/wiki/Evergreen "Evergreen") [tree](/wiki/Tree "Tree") with small ovate or round, mottled leaves with a toothy margin, and young twigs grow zig-zag, and fragrant white flowers in 5 cm panicles and later black chewy berries.[[2]](#cite_note-2) It is an endemic of [New Zealand](/wiki/New_Zealand "New Zealand"). Its most common name is **putaputāwētā**, which means many [wētā](/wiki/W%C4%93t%C4%81 "Wētā") emerge – referring to the [nocturnal](/wiki/Nocturnality "Nocturnality") [Orthoptera](/wiki/Orthoptera "Orthoptera") that live in holes in the trunk of this tree made by [pūriri moth](/wiki/P%C5%ABriri_moth "Pūriri moth") caterpillars. Regional variations on the name also refer to this insect that lives and feeds on it such as kaiwētā, and punawētā.[[3]](#cite_note-:0-3) The tree is also sometimes called *marbleleaf*.[[4]](#cite_note-4) It is found in broadleaf forest in the [North](/wiki/North_Island "North Island"), [South](/wiki/South_Island "South Island") and [Stewart Islands](/wiki/Stewart_Island "Stewart Island"). It flowers between November and March, and fruits are ripe from January to February.[[5]](#cite_note-NZPCN-5)[[6]](#cite_note-TERRAIN-6)

## Description

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Carpodetus_serratus&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Description")]

Putaputāwētā is small tree of up to 10 m in height. It develops a slender trunk of up to 30 cm in diameter, which is covered by rough and corky bark, has a mottled grey-white colouring and is often knobbly due to boring by insects. Juvenile branches have an obvious zig-zag orientation, which becomes less distinctive when older. There are clearly visible [lenticels](/wiki/Lenticel "Lenticel"). The [leaf stems](/wiki/Petiole_(botany) "Petiole (botany)") are about 1 cm. The leaf blades are thin to slightly leathery, broad-elliptic, often widest near the base, or almost round, 4–6 × 2–3 cm when fully grown, dark green near the larger veins and yellowish green removed from the veins. They have a rounded, sometimes somewhat unequal foot, a serrated toothed margin and a pointed or blunt tip. The stems of the leaves, [inflorescences](/wiki/Peduncle_(botany) "Peduncle (botany)") and [flowers](/wiki/Pedicel_(botany) "Pedicel (botany)") are covered in [felty hairs](/wiki/Trichome "Trichome"). The inflorescences are [panicles](/wiki/Panicle "Panicle") of 5 cm in diameter and consist of up to fifteen or more flowers at the leaf axil or at the end of branches. Individual flowers are 5–6 mm, mostly [pentamerous](/wiki/Merosity "Merosity") but possibly occasionally trimerous. The calyx lobes are approximately 1 mm long, narrowly triangular. The [petals](/wiki/Petal "Petal") are white, triangular, 3–4 × 2–3 mm. [Stamens](/wiki/Stamen "Stamen") are alternating with the petals and have short filaments. The [anthers](/wiki/Anther "Anther") are connected to the filaments at their base, open in lengthwise slits towards the inside, through which the yellow [pollen](/wiki/Pollen "Pollen") is shed in tetrads. The [stigma](/wiki/Stigma_(botany) "Stigma (botany)") is bud-shaped, with a dark bluish purple top. The [pistil](/wiki/Pistil "Pistil") is shed after the petals and anthers. The fruit is a somewhat fleshy round berry of 4–6 mm that turns black when it ripens, the lower half is cupped by the remains of calyx. The berry contains many seeds in three to five [compartments](/wiki/Locule "Locule"), each seed 1–2 mm long with a netted outer skin.[[5]](#cite_note-NZPCN-5)[[7]](#cite_note-7)[[8]](#cite_note-AkldUni-8)[[9]](#cite_note-9)

## Taxonomy

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Carpodetus_serratus&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Taxonomy")]

*Carpodetus* and its [type species](/wiki/Type_species "Type species") *C. serratus* were first described by father and son Forster in 1773 and placed in the [Saxifragaceae](/wiki/Saxifragaceae "Saxifragaceae"). In 1934 it was assigned to the newly created [Escalloniaceae](/wiki/Escalloniaceae "Escalloniaceae") by [Hutchinson](/wiki/John_Hutchinson_(botanist) "John Hutchinson (botanist)") in his major revision of the dicotyledon families.[[10]](#cite_note-Brook-10) In the [APG III system](/wiki/APG_III_system "APG III system"), *Carpodetus* has been referred to the [Rousseaceae](/wiki/Rousseaceae "Rousseaceae").

### Etymology

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Carpodetus_serratus&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Etymology")]

*Carpodetus* is derived from the [Greek](/wiki/Ancient_Greek "Ancient Greek") words καρπός (karpos) 'fruit' and detus (bound together), a reference that the seeds are bound together in clusters in the berry. The species [epithet](/wiki/Epithet "Epithet") *serratus* is [Latin](/wiki/Latin "Latin") and means shaped like a saw, from serra (saw).[[11]](#cite_note-11)
The [Māori](/wiki/M%C4%81ori_language "Māori language") name *putaputāwētā* refers to the fact that *[wētā](/wiki/W%C4%93t%C4%81 "Wētā")* often shelter in old burrows of pūriri caterpillars.[[12]](#cite_note-TeAra-12) The fact that freshly cut wood contains so much sap that it is difficult to burn gave rise to the name bucket-of-water-tree.[[6]](#cite_note-TERRAIN-6)

## Ecology

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Carpodetus_serratus&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Ecology")]

This tree prefers moist broadleaf forest and is locally common in *[Nothofagus](/wiki/Nothofagus "Nothofagus")*-forest. It also frequently occurs in secondary forest, forest margins and along streams. The caterpillars of the [pūriri moth](/wiki/P%C5%ABriri_moth "Pūriri moth") (*Aenetus virescens*) feed on the [cambium](/wiki/Cambium "Cambium") thus creating characteristic diamond-shaped feeding scars. The entrance of the burrow is hidden by a web spun by the caterpillar. Trees may be weakened by a high density of caterpillars, particularly if the trunks are still thin.[[5]](#cite_note-NZPCN-5) The workers of *[Prolasius advenus](/wiki/Prolasius_advenus "Prolasius advenus")* (small brown bush ant) feed on the sap trickling from the wounds in the tree caused by the caterpillars.[[6]](#cite_note-TERRAIN-6) When the pūriri moth caterpillar has left the hole is used by [tree wētā](/wiki/Tree_w%C4%93t%C4%81 "Tree wētā") (*Hemideina* spp.) as a daytime refuge.[[3]](#cite_note-:0-3) At night the tree wētā eat the leaves and fruits of the tree – explaining why this species is called kaiwētā by [Tūhoe](/wiki/Ng%C4%81i_T%C5%ABhoe "Ngāi Tūhoe") iwi.

## Cultivation

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Carpodetus_serratus&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Cultivation")]

Marbleleaf adapts well to garden use and is widely cultivated in New Zealand. It remains a compact, rounded shrub for several years before finally developing its adult tree-like form. Marbleleaf may be trimmed to keep it compact and bushy. Well grown plants will flower heavily. As far as can be ascertained there are no commercially distributed *Carpodetus serratus* cultivars.
