Chemical compound

**Pseudopterosin A** is a [diterpene](/wiki/Diterpene "Diterpene") [glycoside](/wiki/Glycoside "Glycoside") isolated from the gorgonian sea whip *[Antillogorgia elisabethae](/wiki/Pseudopterogorgia_elisabethae "Pseudopterogorgia elisabethae")*, found in the Bahamas and Florida Keys.[[1]](#cite_note-Kohl2003-1) Pseudopterosins A-D, which differ in the degree of acetylation at the sugar ring, were first isolated and reported in 1986.[[2]](#cite_note-2) There are at least 25 unique diterpenes isolated from this species of marine animal.[[1]](#cite_note-Kohl2003-1) Samples of *P. elisabethae* from the Bahamas are found to have higher concentrations of pseudopterosins than populations from the Florida Keys, which have a greater diversity in diterpene structures.[[3]](#cite_note-3)

## Uses

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pseudopterosin_A&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Uses")]

Pseudopterosins have anti-inflammatory and analgesic activity, with a mechanism of action different from the common non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, [NSAIDs](/wiki/NSAIDs "NSAIDs").[[4]](#cite_note-4) Commercially, pseudopterosins are found in skin creams as topical anti-inflammatory agents.[[5]](#cite_note-5)

## Biosynthesis

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Pseudopterosin_A&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Biosynthesis")]

Elisabethatriene (**2**) has been identified as a key intermediate for the synthesis of the class of pseudopterosins and *seco*-pseudopterosins. A proposed mechanistic pathway for the synthesis of elisabethatriene from [geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate](/wiki/Geranylgeranyl_pyrophosphate "Geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate") (GGPP, **1**), is described below. Elisabethatriene synthase, a diterpene cyclase enzyme, catalyzes the transformation of the diterpene GGPP to a 10-membered carbon skeleton followed by hydride migration towards the bicyclic ring system.[[1]](#cite_note-Kohl2003-1)[[6]](#cite_note-Kerr2006-6) This cyclase enzyme has been identified as a key enzyme in forming the carbon skeleton of pseudopterosins in one step. An alternative mechanism has been proposed in which a six-membered ring is formed first, then a second ring closing for the bicyclic system.[[6]](#cite_note-Kerr2006-6)

The biosynthesis of the pseudopterosins continues with an aromatization to erogorgiaene (**3**), two oxidations to a dihyroxyerogorgiaene (**4**, then **5**), and another oxidation to an ortho-hydroxyquinone (**6**). Ring closure (**7**), re-aromatization to (**8**) and glycosylation yield Pseudopterosin A (**9**). This is a plausible biosynthetic pathway, and intermediates **2**, **3**, **6**, **7**, and **8** have been identified using radio labeling studies.[[1]](#cite_note-Kohl2003-1) An alternative mechanism has been proposed with no hydroxyquinone intermediate (**6**). Rather, molecule **3** undergoes two subsequent oxidations at C-6 and C-7 to a structure resembling **8**, then glycosylation to pseudopterosin.[[6]](#cite_note-Kerr2006-6)

The branching point for the biosynthesis of the tricyclic pseudopterosins versus the bicyclic *seco*-pseudopterosins occurs at compound **11**, the aromatized bicycle erogorgiaene. **11** is oxidized once then hydroxylated followed by glycosylation to make the bicyclic *seco*-pseudopterosins.

The proposed synthesis of artificial anti-inflammatory metabolites is modeled after pseudopterosins and is based on the bicyclic *seco*-pseudopterosin structure **6**.[[1]](#cite_note-Kohl2003-1)
