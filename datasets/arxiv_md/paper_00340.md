## Abstract

The move to 6th Generation (6G) wireless networks creates new issues with privacy, scalability, and adaptability. The data-intensive nature of 6G is not handled well by older, centralized network models. A shift toward more secure and decentralized systems is therefore required. A new framework called the Federated Learning-based Decentralized Adaptive Intelligent Transmission Protocol (AITP) is proposed to meet these challenges. The AITP uses the distributed learning of Federated Learning (FL) within a decentralized system. Transmission parameters can be adjusted intelligently in real time. User privacy is maintained by keeping raw data on local edge devices. The protocol's performance was evaluated with mathematical modeling and detailed simulations. It was shown to be superior to traditional non-adaptive and centralized AI methods across several key metrics. These included latency, network throughput, energy efficiency, and robustness. The AITP is presented as a foundational technology for future 6G networks that supports a user-centric, privacy-first design. This study is a step forward for privacy-preserving research in 6G.
