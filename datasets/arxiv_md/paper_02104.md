## Abstract

This paper investigates the fundamental discontinuity between the latest two Segment Anything Models: SAM2 and SAM3. We explain why the expertise in prompt-based segmentation of SAM2 does not transfer to the multimodal concept-driven paradigm of SAM3. SAM2 operates through spatial prompts points, boxes, and masks yielding purely geometric and temporal segmentation. In contrast, SAM3 introduces a unified vision-language architecture capable of open-vocabulary reasoning, semantic grounding, contrastive alignment, and exemplar-based concept understanding. We structure this analysis through five core components: (1) a Conceptual Break Between Prompt-Based and Concept-Based Segmentation, contrasting spatial prompt semantics of SAM2 with multimodal fusion and text-conditioned mask generation of SAM3; (2) Architectural Divergence, detailing pure vision-temporal design of SAM2 versus integration of vision-language encoders, geometry and exemplar encoders, fusion modules, DETR-style decoders, object queries, and ambiguity-handling via Mixture-of-Experts in SAM3; (3) Dataset and Annotation Differences, contrasting SA-V video masks with multimodal concept-annotated corpora of SAM3; (4) Training and Hyperparameter Distinctions, showing why SAM2 optimization knowledge does not apply to SAM3; and (5) Evaluation, Metrics, and Failure Modes, outlining the transition from geometric IoU metrics to semantic, open-vocabulary evaluation. Together, these analyses establish SAM3 as a new class of segmentation foundation model and chart future directions for the emerging concept-driven segmentation era.
