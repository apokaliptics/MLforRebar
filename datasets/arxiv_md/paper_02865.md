## Abstract

Recent advancements in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly transformed various industries. In agriculture, these dual-modal capabilities offer promising applications such as precision farming, crop monitoring, pest detection, and environmental sustainability. While several Visual Question Answering (VQA) datasets and benchmarks have been developed to evaluate VLM performance, they often fail to adequately assess the critical reasoning and problem-solving skills required in complex agricultural contexts. To address this gap, we introduce AgriCoT, a VQA dataset that incorporates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, specifically designed to evaluate the reasoning capabilities of VLMs. With 4,535 carefully curated samples, AgriCoT offers a comprehensive and robust evaluation of reasoning abilities for VLMs, particularly in zero-shot scenarios, by focusing on their capacity to engage in logical reasoning and effective problem-solving. Our evaluations, conducted with 26 representative VLMs, including both proprietary and open-source models, reveal that while some proprietary models excel at answering questions, there is a notable and significant gap in their reasoning capabilities. This underscores the importance of incorporating CoT for more precise and effective assessments. Our dataset are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/wenyb/AgriCoT.
