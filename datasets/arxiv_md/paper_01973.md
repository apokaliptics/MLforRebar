## Abstract

This study focuses on event detection in optical fibers, specifically classifying six events using the Phase-OTDR system. A novel approach is introduced to enhance Phase-OTDR data analysis by transforming 1D data into grayscale images through techniques such as Gramian Angular Difference Field, Gramian Angular Summation Field, and Recurrence Plot. These grayscale images are combined into a multi-channel RGB representation, enabling more robust and adaptable analysis using transfer learning models. The proposed methodology achieves high classification accuracies of 98.84% and 98.24% with the EfficientNetB0 and DenseNet121 models, respectively. A 5-fold cross-validation process confirms the reliability of these models, with test accuracy rates of 99.07% and 98.68%. Using a publicly available Phase-OTDR dataset, the study demonstrates an efficient approach to understanding optical fiber events while reducing dataset size and improving analysis efficiency. The results highlight the transformative potential of image-based analysis in interpreting complex fiber optic sensing data, offering significant advancements in the accuracy and reliability of fiber optic monitoring systems. The codes and the corresponding image-based dataset are made publicly available on GitHub to support further research: https://github.com/miralab-ai/Phase-OTDR-event-detection.
