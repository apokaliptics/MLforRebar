## Abstract

In medical data analysis, extracting deep insights from complex, multi-modal datasets is essential for improving patient care, increasing diagnostic accuracy, and optimizing healthcare operations. However, there is currently a lack of high-quality datasets specifically designed to evaluate the ability of large multi-modal models (LMMs) to discover medical insights. In this paper, we introduce MedInsightBench, the first benchmark that comprises 332 carefully curated medical cases, each annotated with thoughtfully designed insights. This benchmark is intended to evaluate the ability of LMMs and agent frameworks to analyze multi-modal medical image data, including posing relevant questions, interpreting complex findings, and synthesizing actionable insights and recommendations. Our analysis indicates that existing LMMs exhibit limited performance on MedInsightBench, which is primarily attributed to their challenges in extracting multi-step, deep insights and the absence of medical expertise. Therefore, we propose MedInsightAgent, an automated agent framework for medical data analysis, composed of three modules: Visual Root Finder, Analytical Insight Agent, and Follow-up Question Composer. Experiments on MedInsightBench highlight pervasive challenges and demonstrate that MedInsightAgent can improve the performance of general LMMs in medical data insight discovery.
