## Abstract

Existing appliance assets suffer from poor rendering, incomplete mechanisms, and misalignment with manuals, leading to simulation-reality gaps that hinder appliance manipulation development. In this work, we introduce the RealAppliance dataset, comprising 100 high-fidelity appliances with complete physical, electronic mechanisms, and program logic aligned with their manuals. Based on these assets, we propose the RealAppliance-Bench benchmark, which evaluates multimodal large language models and embodied manipulation planning models across key tasks in appliance manipulation planning: manual page retrieval, appliance part grounding, open-loop manipulation planning, and closed-loop planning adjustment. Our analysis of model performances on RealAppliance-Bench provides insights for advancing appliance manipulation research
