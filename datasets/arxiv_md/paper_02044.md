## Abstract

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated exceptional performance across various tasks, but their security vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to generate harmful content, causing adverse impacts across various societal domains. Most existing jailbreak methods revolve around Prompt Engineering or adversarial optimization, yet we identify a previously overlooked phenomenon: many harmful scenarios are highly consistent with legitimate ones in terms of underlying principles. Based on this finding, this paper proposes the Safe2Harm Semantic Isomorphism Attack method, which achieves efficient jailbreaking through four stages: first, rewrite the harmful question into a semantically safe question with similar underlying principles; second, extract the thematic mapping relationship between the two; third, let the LLM generate a detailed response targeting the safe question; finally, reversely rewrite the safe response based on the thematic mapping relationship to obtain harmful output. Experiments on 7 mainstream LLMs and three types of benchmark datasets show that Safe2Harm exhibits strong jailbreaking capability, and its overall performance is superior to existing methods. Additionally, we construct a challenging harmful content evaluation dataset containing 358 samples and evaluate the effectiveness of existing harmful detection methods, which can be deployed for LLM input-output filtering to enable defense.
