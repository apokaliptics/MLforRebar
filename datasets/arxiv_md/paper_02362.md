## Abstract

This research presents a novel approach to enhancing automatic speech recognition systems by integrating noise detection capabilities directly into the recognition architecture. Building upon the wav2vec2 framework, the proposed method incorporates a dedicated noise identification module that operates concurrently with speech transcription. Experimental validation using publicly available speech and environmental audio datasets demonstrates substantial improvements in transcription quality and noise discrimination. The enhanced system achieves superior performance in word error rate, character error rate, and noise detection accuracy compared to conventional architectures. Results indicate that joint optimization of transcription and noise classification objectives yields more reliable speech recognition in challenging acoustic conditions.
