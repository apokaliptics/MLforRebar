## Abstract

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is gaining recognition as one of the key technological axes for next generation information retrieval, owing to its ability to mitigate the hallucination phenomenon in Large Language
  Models (LLMs)and effectively incorporate up-to-date information. However, specialized expertise is necessary to
  construct ahigh-quality retrieval system independently; moreover, RAGdemonstratesrelativelyslowerprocessing
  speeds compared to conventional pure retrieval systems because it involves both retrieval and generation stages.
  Accordingly, this study proposes SHRAG, a novel framework designed to facilitate the seamless integration of
  Information Retrieval and RAG while simultaneously securing precise retrieval performance. SHRAG utilizes a
  Large Language Model as a Query Strategist to automatically transform unstructured natural language queries
  into logically structured search queries, subsequently performing Boolean retrieval to emulate the search process
  of an expert human searcher. Furthermore, it incorporates multilingual query expansion and a multilingual
  embedding model, enabling it to perform efficient cross-lingual question answering within the multilingual
  dataset environment of the ScienceON Challenge. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method,
  combining logical retrieval capabilities and generative reasoning, can significantly enhance the accuracy and
  reliability of RAG systems. Furthermore, SHRAG movesbeyondconventionaldocument-centric retrieval methods,
  presenting the potential for a new search paradigm capable of providing direct and reliable responses to queries.
