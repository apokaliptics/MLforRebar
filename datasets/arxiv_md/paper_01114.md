## Abstract

Olympic Taekwondo has faced challenges in spectator engagement due to static, defensive gameplay and contentious scoring. Current Protector and Scoring Systems (PSS) rely on impact sensors and simplistic logic, encouraging safe strategies that diminish the sport's dynamism. This paper proposes an AI-powered scoring system that integrates existing PSS sensors with additional accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetic/RFID, and impact force sensors in a sensor fusion framework. The system classifies kicks in real-time to identify technique type, contact location, impact force, and even the part of the foot used. A machine learning pipeline employing sensor fusion and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) is detailed, enabling automatic kick technique recognition for scoring. We present a novel kick scoring rubric that awards points based on specific kick techniques (e.g., turning and spinning kicks) to incentivize dynamic attacks. Drawing on a 2024 study achieving 96-98% accuracy, we validate the feasibility of real-time kick classification and further propose enhancements to this methodology, such as ensemble SVM classifiers and expanded datasets, to achieve the high-stakes accuracy required by the sport. We analyze how the proposed system can improve scoring fairness, reduce rule exploitation and illegitimate tactics, encourage more dynamic techniques, and enhance spectator understanding and excitement. The paper includes system design illustrations, a kick scoring table from an AI-augmented rule set, and discusses anticipated impacts on Olympic Taekwondo.
