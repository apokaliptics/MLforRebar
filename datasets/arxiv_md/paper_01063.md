## Abstract

The rapid acceleration of scientific publishing has created substantial challenges for researchers attempting to discover, contextualize, and interpret relevant literature. Traditional keyword-based search systems provide limited semantic understanding, while existing AI-driven tools typically focus on isolated tasks such as retrieval, clustering, or bibliometric visualization. This paper presents an integrated system for scientific literature exploration that combines large-scale data acquisition, hybrid retrieval, semantic topic modeling, and heterogeneous knowledge graph construction. The system builds a comprehensive corpus by merging full-text data from arXiv with structured metadata from OpenAlex. A hybrid retrieval architecture fuses BM25 lexical search with embedding-based semantic search using Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Topic modeling is performed on retrieved results using BERTopic or non-negative matrix factorization depending on computational resources. A knowledge graph unifies papers, authors, institutions, countries, and extracted topics into an interpretable structure. The system provides a multi-layered exploration environment that reveals not only relevant publications but also the conceptual and relational landscape surrounding a query. Evaluation across multiple queries demonstrates improvements in retrieval relevance, topic coherence, and interpretability. The proposed framework contributes an extensible foundation for AI-assisted scientific discovery.
