## Abstract

Using the example of the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, this chapter illustrates the challenges posed by an AI capable of making decisions that go against human interests. But are human decisions always rational and ethical? In reality, the cognitive decision-making process is influenced by cognitive biases that affect our behavior and choices. AI not only reproduces these biases, but can also exploit them, with the potential to shape our decisions and judgments. Behind IA algorithms, there are sometimes individuals who show little concern for fundamental rights and impose their own rules. To address the ethical and societal challenges raised by AI and its governance, the regulation of digital platforms and education are keys levers. Regulation must reflect ethical, legal, and political choices, while education must strengthen digital literacy and teach people to make informed and critical choices when facing digital technologies.
