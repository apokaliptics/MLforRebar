## Abstract

Advancing artificial intelligence for physical sciences requires representations that are both interpretable and compatible with the underlying laws of nature. We introduce METASTRINGS, a symbolic language for photonics that expresses nanostructures as textual sequences encoding materials, geometries, and lattice configurations. Analogous to molecular textual representations in chemistry, METASTRINGS provides a framework connecting human interpretability with computational design by capturing the structural hierarchy of photonic metasurfaces. Building on this representation, we develop Meta-GPT, a foundation transformer model trained on METASTRINGS and finetuned with physics-informed supervised, reinforcement, and chain-of-thought learning. Across various design tasks, the model achieves <3% mean-squared spectral error and maintains >98% syntactic validity, generating diverse metasurface prototypes whose experimentally measured optical responses match their target spectra. These results demonstrate that Meta-GPT can learn the compositional rules of light-matter interactions through METASTRINGS, laying a rigorous foundation for AI-driven photonics and representing an important step toward a metasurface genome project.
