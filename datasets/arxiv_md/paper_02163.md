## Abstract

Objective: To develop the AI Product Passport, a standards-based framework improving transparency, traceability, and compliance in healthcare AI via lifecycle-based documentation. Materials and Methods: The AI Product Passport was developed within the AI4HF project, focusing on heart failure AI tools. We analyzed regulatory frameworks (EU AI Act, FDA guidelines) and existing standards to design a relational data model capturing metadata across AI lifecycle phases: study definition, dataset preparation, model generation/evaluation, deployment/monitoring, and passport generation. MLOps/ModelOps concepts were integrated for operational relevance. Co-creation involved feedback from AI4HF consortium and a Lisbon workshop with 21 diverse stakeholders, evaluated via Mentimeter polls. The open-source platform was implemented with Python libraries for automated provenance tracking. Results: The AI Product Passport was designed based on existing standards and methods with well-defined lifecycle management and role-based access. Its implementation is a web-based platform with a relational data model supporting auditable documentation. It generates machine- and human-readable reports, customizable for stakeholders. It aligns with FUTURE-AI principles (Fairness, Universality, Traceability, Usability, Robustness, Explainability), ensuring fairness, traceability, and usability. Exported passports detail model purpose, data provenance, performance, and deployment context. GitHub-hosted backend/frontend codebases enhance accessibility. Discussion and Conclusion: The AI Product Passport addresses transparency gaps in healthcare AI, meeting regulatory and ethical demands. Its open-source nature and alignment with standards foster trust and adaptability. Future enhancements include FAIR data principles and FHIR integration for improved interoperability, promoting responsible AI deployment.
