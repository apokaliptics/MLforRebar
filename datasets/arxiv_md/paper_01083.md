## Abstract

Recent advances in Generative AI (GAI) have led to new opportunities for creativity support. However, this technology has raised ethical concerns in the visual artists community. This paper explores how GAI can assist visual artists in developing original characters (OCs) while respecting their creative agency. We present ORIBA, an AI chatbot leveraging large language models (LLMs) to enable artists to role-play with their OCs, focusing on conceptualization (e.g., backstories) while leaving exposition (visual creation) to creators. Through a study with 14 artists, we found ORIBA motivated artists' imaginative engagement, developing multidimensional attributes and stronger bonds with OCs that inspire their creative process. Our contributions include design insights for AI systems that develop from artists' perspectives, demonstrating how LLMs can support cross-modal creativity while preserving creative agency in OC art. This paper highlights the potential of GAI as a neutral, non-visual support that strengthens existing creative practice, without infringing artistic exposition.
