## Abstract

This work presents a conceptual study on the application of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for decentralized control of unmanned aerial vehicles to relay a critical data package to a known position. For this purpose, a family of deterministic games is introduced, designed for scaling studies for MARL. A robust baseline policy is proposed, which is based on restricting agent motion envelopes and applying Dijkstra's algorithm. Experimental results show that two off-the-shelf MARL algorithms perform competitively with the baseline for a small number of agents, but scalability issues arise as the number of agents increase.
