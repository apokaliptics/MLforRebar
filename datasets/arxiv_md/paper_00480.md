## Abstract

The significant development of deepfake technology powered by artificial intelligence (AI) has sparked worldwide concerns about the alteration of false information, the usurpation of online identities, and the decline of public confidence in the authenticity of online content. These incidents not only raise technical issues but also carry complex moral implications, rendering conventional, technologically driven, and reactive management methods inadequate to address the underlying causes of the problem, including intent, morality, and potential intangible social impacts. Based on these issues, this study aims to formulate a comprehensive Islamic ethical framework that can serve as a more comprehensive preventative tool to mitigate the risks of misuse of deepfakes. The study employed a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) guided by PRISMA, selecting ten primary sources published between 2018 and 2025 to identify ethical deficiencies, regulatory needs, and appropriate normative solutions. The analysis shows that the integration of the principles of (Maqasid al-Shariah) particularly (hifz al-ird) protecting honor and (hifz al-nafs) protecting the self, provides a strong normative basis for regulating the responsible use of technology. This study yields three strategic recommendations: regulatory changes that recognize the intangible and psychological harm caused by reputational damage; improved technology management through moral scrutiny that upholds the values of justice (adl), trust, and openness; and increased public digital literacy based on the principle of (tabayyun) examination and caution. Overall, this study concludes that the application of Islamic ethics offers a shift in thinking from punitive mechanisms to preventative approaches that focus on protecting human dignity, preventing harm, and strengthening the common good in the digital age.
