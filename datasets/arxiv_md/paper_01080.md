## Abstract

This paper introduces the concept of value awareness in AI, which goes beyond the traditional value-alignment problem. Our definition of value awareness presents us with a concise and simplified roadmap for engineering value-aware AI. The roadmap is structured around three core pillars: (1) learning and representing human values using formal semantics, (2) ensuring the value alignment of both individual agents and multiagent systems, and (3) providing value-based explainability on behaviour. The paper presents a selection of our ongoing work on some of these topics, along with applications to real-life domains.
