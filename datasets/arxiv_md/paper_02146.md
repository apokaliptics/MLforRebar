## Abstract

For years, the discourse around poker AI has been dominated by the concept of solvers and the pursuit of unexploitable, machine-perfect play. This paper challenges that orthodoxy. It presents Patrick, an AI built on the contrary philosophy: that the path to victory lies not in being unexploitable, but in being maximally exploitative. Patrick's architecture is a purpose-built engine for understanding and attacking the flawed, psychological, and often irrational nature of human opponents. Through detailed analysis of its design, its novel prediction-anchored learning method, and its profitable performance in a 64,267-hand trial, this paper makes the case that the solved myth is a distraction from the real, far more interesting challenge: creating AI that can master the art of human imperfection.
