## Abstract

Hybrid quantum and classical learning aims to couple quantum feature maps with the robustness of classical neural networks, yet most architectures treat the quantum circuit as an isolated feature extractor and merge its measurements with classical representations by direct concatenation. This neglects that the quantum and classical branches constitute distinct computational modalities and limits reliable performance on complex, high dimensional tabular and semi structured data, including remote sensing, environmental monitoring, and medical diagnostics. We present a multimodal formulation of hybrid learning and propose a cross attention mid fusion architecture in which a classical representation queries quantum derived feature tokens through an attention block with residual connectivity. The quantum branch is kept within practical NISQ budgets and uses up to nine qubits. We evaluate on Wine, Breast Cancer, Forest CoverType, FashionMNIST, and SteelPlatesFaults, comparing a quantum only model, a classical baseline, residual hybrid models, and the proposed mid fusion model under a consistent protocol. Pure quantum and standard hybrid designs underperform due to measurement induced information loss, while cross attention mid fusion is consistently competitive and improves performance on the more complex datasets in most cases. These findings suggest that quantum derived information becomes most valuable when integrated through principled multimodal fusion rather than used in isolation or loosely appended to classical features.
