## Abstract

Precise grading of meniscal horn tears is critical in knee injury diagnosis but remains underexplored in automated MRI analysis. Existing methods often rely on coarse study-level labels or binary classification, lacking localization and severity information. In this paper, we introduce MeniMV, a multi-view benchmark dataset specifically designed for horn-specific meniscus injury grading. MeniMV comprises 3,000 annotated knee MRI exams from 750 patients across three medical centers, providing 6,000 co-registered sagittal and coronal images. Each exam is meticulously annotated with four-tier (grade 0-3) severity labels for both anterior and posterior meniscal horns, verified by chief orthopedic physicians. Notably, MeniMV offers more than double the pathology-labeled data volume of prior datasets while uniquely capturing the dual-view diagnostic context essential in clinical practice. To demonstrate the utility of MeniMV, we benchmark multiple state-of-the-art CNN and Transformer-based models. Our extensive experiments establish strong baselines and highlight challenges in severity grading, providing a valuable foundation for future research in automated musculoskeletal imaging.
