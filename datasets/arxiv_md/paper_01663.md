## Abstract

The rapid growth of cloud computing in the Electronic Design Automation (EDA) industry has created a critical need for resource and job lifetime prediction to achieve optimal scheduling. Traditional machine learning methods often struggle with the complexity and heterogeneity of EDA workloads, requiring extensive feature engineering and domain expertise. We propose a novel framework that fine-tunes Large Language Models (LLMs) to address this challenge through text-to-text regression. We introduce the scientific notation and prefix filling to constrain the LLM, significantly improving output format reliability. Moreover, we found that full-attention finetuning and inference improves the prediction accuracy of sliding-window-attention LLMs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework on real-world cloud datasets, setting a new baseline for performance prediction in the EDA domain.
