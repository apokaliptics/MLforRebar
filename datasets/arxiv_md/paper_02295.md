## Abstract

We implemented a Soft Decision Tree (SDT) and a Short-term Memory Soft Decision Tree (SM-SDT) using PyTorch. The methods were extensively tested on simulated and clinical datasets. The SDT was visualized to demonstrate the potential for its explainability. SDT, SM-SDT, and XGBoost demonstrated similar area under the curve (AUC) values. These methods were better than Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree. The results on clinical datasets suggest that, aside from a decision tree, all tested classification methods yield comparable results.
  The code and datasets are available online on GitHub: https://github.com/KI-Research-Institute/Soft-Decision-Tree
