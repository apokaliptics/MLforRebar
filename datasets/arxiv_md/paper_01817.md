## Abstract

Researchers struggle to efficiently locate and manage relevant literature within the exponentially growing body of scientific publications. We present \textsc{WisPaper}, an intelligent academic retrieval and literature management platform that addresses this challenge through three integrated capabilities: (1) \textit{Scholar Search}, featuring both quick keyword-based and deep agentic search modes for efficient paper discovery; (2) \textit{Library}, a customizable knowledge base for systematic literature organization; and (3) \textit{AI Feeds}, an intelligent recommendation system that automatically delivers relevant new publications based on user interests. Unlike existing academic tools, \textsc{WisPaper} provides a closed-loop workflow that seamlessly connects literature discovery, management, and continuous tracking of research frontiers. Our multilingual and multidisciplinary system significantly reduces the time researchers from diverse backgrounds spend on paper screening and management, enabling them to focus on their core research activities. The platform is publicly accessible and serves researchers across academia and industry.
