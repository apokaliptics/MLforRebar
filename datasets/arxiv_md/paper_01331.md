## Abstract

This paper presents the Unified Smart Factory Model (USFM), a comprehensive framework designed to translate high-level sustainability goals into measurable factory-level indicators with a systematic information map of manufacturing activities. The manufacturing activities were modelled as set of manufacturing, assembly and auxiliary processes using Object Process Methodology, a Model Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) language. USFM integrates Manufacturing Process and System, Data Process, and Key Performance Indicator (KPI) Selection and Assessment in a single framework. Through a detailed case study of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) assembly factory, the paper demonstrates how environmental sustainability KPIs can be selected, modelled, and mapped to the necessary data, highlighting energy consumption and environmental impact metrics. The model's systematic approach can reduce redundancy, minimize the risk of missing critical information, and enhance data collection. The paper concluded that the USFM bridges the gap between sustainability goals and practical implementation, providing significant benefits for industries specifically SMEs aiming to achieve sustainability targets.
