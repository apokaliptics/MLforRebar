## Abstract

Deep generative models have become powerful priors for solving inverse problems, and various training-free methods have been developed. However, when applied to latent flow models, existing methods often fail to converge to the posterior mode or suffer from manifold deviation within latent spaces. To mitigate this, here we introduce a novel training-free framework, FlowLPS, that solves inverse problems with pretrained flow models via a Langevin Proximal Sampling (LPS) strategy. Our method integrates Langevin dynamics for manifold-consistent exploration with proximal optimization for precise mode seeking, achieving a superior balance between reconstruction fidelity and perceptual quality across multiple inverse tasks on FFHQ and DIV2K, outperforming state of the art inverse solvers.
