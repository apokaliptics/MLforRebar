## Abstract

This survey reviews hyperbolic graph embedding models, and evaluate them on anomaly detection, highlighting their advantages over Euclidean methods in capturing complex structures. Evaluating models like \textit{HGCAE}, \textit{\(\mathcal{P}\)-VAE}, and \textit{HGCN} demonstrates high performance, with \textit{\(\mathcal{P}\)-VAE} achieving an F1-score of 94\% on the \textit{Elliptic} dataset and \textit{HGCAE} scoring 80\% on \textit{Cora}. In contrast, Euclidean methods like \textit{DOMINANT} and \textit{GraphSage} struggle with complex data. The study emphasizes the potential of hyperbolic spaces for improving anomaly detection, and provides an open-source library to foster further research in this field.
