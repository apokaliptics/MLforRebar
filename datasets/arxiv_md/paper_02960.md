## Abstract

Background: Accurate proton resonance frequency (PRF) MR thermometry is essential for monitoring temperature rise during thermal ablation with high intensity focused ultrasound (FUS). Conventional referenceless methods such as complex field estimation (CFE) and phase finite difference (PFD) tend to exhibit errors when susceptibility-induced phase discontinuities occur at tissue interfaces.
