## Abstract

ML-Enabled Systems (MLES) are inherently complex since they require multiple components to achieve their business goal. This experience report showcases the software architecture reusability techniques applied while building Ocean Guard, an MLES for anomaly detection in the maritime domain. In particular, it highlights the challenges and lessons learned to reuse the Ports and Adapters pattern to support building multiple microservices from a single codebase. This experience report hopes to inspire software engineers, machine learning engineers, and data scientists to apply the Hexagonal Architecture pattern to build their MLES.
