## Abstract

The growing presence of IoT devices in academic environments has increased operational complexity and exposed security weaknesses, especially in academic institutions without unified policies for registration, monitoring, and incident response involving IoT. This work presents IoTEdu, an integrated platform that combines access control, incident detection, and automatic blocking of IoT devices. The solution was evaluated in a controlled environment with simulated attacks, achieving an average time of 28.6 seconds between detection and blocking. The results show a reduction in manual intervention, standardization of responses, and unification of the processes of registration, monitoring, and incident response.
