## Abstract

With the recent digital revolution, analyzing of tourists' behaviors and research fields associated with it have changed profoundly. It is now easier to examine behaviors of tourists using digital traces they leave during their travels. The studies conducted on diverse aspects of tourism focus on quantitative aspects of digital traces to reach its conclusions. In this paper, we suggest a study focused on both qualitative and quantitative aspect of digital traces to understand the dynamics governing tourist behavior, especially those concerning attractions networks.
