## Abstract

In firefighting and other emergency operations, decisions made under pressure carry profound ethical weight and can significantly impact incident outcomes and firefighter safety. Traditional training methods, while foundational, often fall short in adequately preparing firefighters for the complex ethical dilemmas and value conflicts inherent in chaotic emergency environments. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for enhancing firefighter training by systematically integrating departmental values into simulation-based training. This approach fosters deeper value internalisation and improves value-driven decision-making under pressure. Furthermore, the underlying tools can also be leveraged to evaluate and refine departmental operational protocols for better alignment with preferred values.
