## Abstract

This paper presents a novel approach to automated stripboard circuit layout design using Answer Set Programming (ASP). The work formulates the layout problem as both a synthesis and multi-objective optimization task that simultaneously generates viable layouts while minimizing board area and component strip crossing. By leveraging ASP's declarative nature, this work expresses complex geometric and electrical constraints in a natural and concise manner. The two-phase solving methodology first ensures feasibility before optimizing layout quality. Experimental results demonstrate that this approach generates compact, manufacturable layouts for a range of circuit complexities. This work represents a significant advancement in automated stripboard layout, offering a practical tool for electronics prototyping and education while showcasing the power of declarative programming for solving complex design automation problems.
