## Abstract

Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) workloads rely on expert parallelism (EP) to achieve high GPU efficiency. State-of-the-art EP communication systems such as DeepEP demonstrate strong performance but exhibit poor portability across heterogeneous GPU and NIC platforms. The poor portability is rooted in architecture: GPU-initiated token-level RDMA communication requires tight vertical integration between GPUs and NICs, e.g., GPU writes to NIC driver/MMIO interfaces.
  We present UCCL-EP, a portable EP communication system that delivers DeepEP-level performance across heterogeneous GPU and NIC hardware. UCCL-EP replaces GPU-initiated RDMA with a high-throughput GPU-CPU control channel: compact token-routing commands are transferred to multithreaded CPU proxies, which then issue GPUDirect RDMA operations on behalf of GPUs. UCCL-EP further emulates various ordering semantics required by specialized EP communication modes using RDMA immediate data, enabling correctness on NICs that lack such ordering, e.g., AWS EFA. We implement UCCL-EP on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs with EFA and Broadcom NICs. On EFA, it outperforms the best existing EP solution by up to $2.1\times$ for dispatch and combine throughput. On NVIDIA-only platform, UCCL-EP achieves comparable performance to the original DeepEP. UCCL-EP also improves token throughput on SGLang by up to 40% on the NVIDIA+EFA platform, and improves DeepSeek-V3 training throughput over the AMD Primus/Megatron-LM framework by up to 45% on a 16-node AMD+Broadcom platform.
