## Abstract

A core capability towards general embodied intelligence lies in localizing task-relevant objects from an egocentric perspective, formulated as Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG). Despite recent progress, existing STVG studies remain largely confined to object-centric and descriptive instructions, neglecting the task-oriented reasoning that is crucial for embodied agents to accomplish goal-directed interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{ToG-Bench}, the first task-oriented spatio-temporal video grounding benchmark for egocentric videos. ToG-Bench is characterized by three key features: (1) \textbf{Task-oriented Grounding}, which requires identifying and localizing objects based on intended tasks rather than straightforward descriptions; (2) \textbf{Explicit-Implicit Dual Grounding}, where target objects can be either explicitly mentioned or implicitly inferred by contextual reasoning; (3) \textbf{One-to-Many Grounding}, where a single instruction may correspond to multiple objects involved in task execution. Built upon videos sourced from ScanNet, ToG-Bench comprises 100 annotated clips with 2,704 task-oriented grounding instructions, constructed via a semi-automated pipeline that combines foundation model annotation and human refinement. In addition, we introduce a set of task-level evaluation metrics tailored for multi-object and explicit-implicit object grounding, and systematically benchmark seven state-of-the-art MLLMs. Extensive experiments reveal the intrinsic challenges of task-oriented STVG and substantial performance gaps across explicit-implicit and multi-object grounding, highlighting the difficulty of bridging perception and interaction in embodied scenarios.
