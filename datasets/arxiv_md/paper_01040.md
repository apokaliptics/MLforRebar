## Abstract

We evaluate adversarial robustness in tabular machine learning models used in financial decision making. Using credit scoring and fraud detection data, we apply gradient based attacks and measure impacts on discrimination, calibration, and financial risk metrics. Results show notable performance degradation under small perturbations and partial recovery through adversarial training.
