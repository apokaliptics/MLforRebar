## Abstract

Medical imaging is essential for clinical diagnosis, yet real-world data frequently suffers from corruption, noise, and potential tampering, challenging the reliability of AI-assisted interpretation. Conventional reconstruction techniques prioritize pixel-level recovery and may produce visually plausible outputs while compromising anatomical fidelity, an issue that can directly impact clinical outcomes. We propose a semantic-aware medical image reconstruction framework that integrates high-level latent embeddings with a hybrid U-Net architecture to preserve clinically relevant structures during restoration. To ensure trust and accountability, we incorporate a lightweight blockchain-based provenance layer using scale-free graph design, enabling verifiable recording of each reconstruction event without imposing significant overhead. Extensive evaluation across multiple datasets and corruption types demonstrates improved structural consistency, restoration accuracy, and provenance integrity compared with existing approaches. By uniting semantic-guided reconstruction with secure traceability, our solution advances dependable AI for medical imaging, enhancing both diagnostic confidence and regulatory compliance in healthcare environments.
