## Abstract

This paper introduces a standardized model card framework specifically designed for digital and web forensics. Building upon established model card methodologies and recent work on abstract models for digital forensic analysis, this paper presents a web based framework that generates model cards specifically designed to represent knowledge in the forensic domain. The framework includes controlled vocabularies for classification, reasoning types, bias identification, and error categorization, along with a web-based generator tool to facilitate adoption. The paper describes the model card structure, presents the controlled vocabularies, and introduces the beta version of the generator tool, inviting community feedback to refine this emerging standard. Ultimately, the systemic risk is that that the anti fraud and digital and web forensics processes are controlled by the mobs.
