## Abstract

Widespread Pb (lead) contamination of urban soil significantly impacts food safety and public health and hinders city greening efforts. However, most existing technologies for measuring Pb are labor-intensive and costly. In this study, we propose SoilScanner, a radio frequency-based wireless system that can detect Pb in soils. This is based on our discovery that the propagation of different frequency band radio signals is affected differently by different salts such as NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in the soil. In a controlled experiment, manually adding NaCl and Pb(NO3)2 in clean soil, we demonstrated that different salts reflected signals at different frequencies in distinct patterns. In addition, we confirmed the finding using uncontrolled field samples with a machine learning model. Our experiment results show that SoilScanner can classify soil samples into low-Pb and high-Pb categories (threshold at 200 ppm) with an accuracy of 72%, with no sample with > 500 ppm of Pb being misclassified. The results of this study show that it is feasible to build portable and affordable Pb detection and screening devices based on wireless technology.
