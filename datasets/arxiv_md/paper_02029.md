## Abstract

Motivated by the challenges of implementing policy-based data access control (PBAC) under multiple simultaneously applicable compliance frameworks, we present Parajudica, an open, modular, and extensible RDF/SPARQL-based rule system for evaluating context-dependent data compliance status. We demonstrate the utility of this resource and accompanying metamodel through application to existing legal frameworks and industry standards, offering insights for comparative framework analysis. Applications include compliance policy enforcement, compliance monitoring, data discovery, and risk assessment.
