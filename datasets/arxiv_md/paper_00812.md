## Abstract

OpenAI has recently argued that hallucinations in large language models result primarily from misaligned evaluation incentives that reward confident guessing rather than epistemic humility. On this view, hallucination is a contingent behavioral artifact, remediable through improved benchmarks and reward structures. In this paper, we challenge that interpretation. Drawing on previous work on structural hallucination and empirical experiments using a Licensing Oracle, we argue that hallucination is not an optimization failure but an architectural inevitability of the transformer model.
  Transformers do not represent the world; they model statistical associations among tokens. Their embedding spaces form a pseudo-ontology derived from linguistic co-occurrence rather than world-referential structure. At ontological boundary conditions - regions where training data is sparse or incoherent - the model necessarily interpolates fictional continuations in order to preserve coherence. No incentive mechanism can modify this structural dependence on pattern completion.
  Our empirical results demonstrate that hallucination can only be eliminated through external truth-validation and abstention modules, not through changes to incentives, prompting, or fine-tuning. The Licensing Oracle achieves perfect abstention precision across domains precisely because it supplies grounding that the transformer lacks.
  We conclude that hallucination is a structural property of generative architectures and that reliable AI requires hybrid systems that distinguish linguistic fluency from epistemic responsibility.
