## Abstract

Predictive maintenance in manufacturing environments presents a challenging optimization problem characterized by extreme cost asymmetry, where missed failures incur costs roughly fifty times higher than false alarms. Conventional machine learning approaches typically optimize statistical accuracy metrics that do not reflect this operational reality and cannot reliably distinguish causal relationships from spurious correlations. This study evaluates eight predictive models, ranging from baseline statistical approaches to formal causal inference methods, on a dataset of 10,000 CNC machines with a 3.3% failure prevalence. The formal causal inference model (L5) achieved estimated annual cost savings of 1.16 million USD (a 70.2 percent reduction), outperforming the best correlation-based decision tree model (L3) by approximately 80,000 USD per year. The causal model matched the highest observed recall (87.9 percent) while reducing false alarms by 97 percent (from 165 to 5) and attained a precision of 92.1 percent, with a train-test performance gap of only 2.6 percentage points. These results indicate that causal AI methods, when combined with domain knowledge, can yield superior financial outcomes and more interpretable predictions compared to correlation-based approaches in predictive maintenance applications.
