## Abstract

Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally. Early detection and diagnosis of pulmonary nodules are essential for improving patient survival rates. Although previous research has integrated multimodal and multi-temporal information, outperforming single modality and single time point, the fusion methods are limited to inefficient vector concatenation and simple mutual attention, highlighting the need for more effective multimodal information fusion. To address these challenges, we introduce a Dual-Graph Spatiotemporal Attention Network, which leverages temporal variations and multimodal data to enhance the accuracy of predictions. Our methodology involves developing a Global-Local Feature Encoder to better capture the local, global, and fused characteristics of pulmonary nodules. Additionally, a Dual-Graph Construction method organizes multimodal features into inter-modal and intra-modal graphs. Furthermore, a Hierarchical Cross-Modal Graph Fusion Module is introduced to refine feature integration. We also compiled a novel multimodal dataset named the NLST-cmst dataset as a comprehensive source of support for related research. Our extensive experiments, conducted on both the NLST-cmst and curated CSTL-derived datasets, demonstrate that our DGSAN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in classifying pulmonary nodules with exceptional computational efficiency.
