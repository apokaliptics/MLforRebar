## Abstract

This study investigates AI integration in architectural education through a teaching experiment in Zhejiang University's 2024-25 grade three undergraduate design studio. Adopting a dual-module framework (20-hour AI training + embedded ethics discussions), the course introduced deep learning models, LLMs, AIGC, LoRA, and ComfyUI while maintaining the original curriculum structure, supported by dedicated technical instructors. Findings demonstrate the effectiveness of phased guidance, balanced technical-ethical approaches, and institutional support. The model improved students' digital skills and strategic cognition while addressing AI ethics, providing a replicable approach combining technical and critical learning in design education.
