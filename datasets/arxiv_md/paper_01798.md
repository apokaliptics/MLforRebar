## Abstract

This paper examines the deployment of seven different neural network architectures CNN, RNN, GNN, Autoencoder, Transformer, NCF, and Siamese Networks on three distinct datasets: Retail E-commerce, Amazon Products, and Netflix Prize. It evaluates their effectiveness through metrics such as accuracy, recall, F1-score, and diversity in recommendations. The results demonstrate that GNNs are particularly adept at managing complex item relationships in e-commerce environments, whereas RNNs are effective in capturing the temporal dynamics that are essential for platforms such as Netflix.. Siamese Networks are emphasized for their contribution to the diversification of recommendations, particularly in retail settings. Despite their benefits, issues like computational demands, reliance on extensive data, and the challenge of balancing accurate and diverse recommendations are addressed. The study seeks to inform the advancement of recommendation systems by suggesting hybrid methods that merge the strengths of various models to better satisfy user preferences and accommodate the evolving demands of contemporary digital platforms.
