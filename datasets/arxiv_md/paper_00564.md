## Abstract

AI is reshaping the landscape of multimedia forensics. We propose AI forensic agents: reliable orchestrators that select and combine forensic detectors, identify provenance and context, and provide uncertainty-aware assessments. We highlight pitfalls in current solutions and introduce a unified framework to improve the authenticity verification process.
