## Abstract

Practically everything computers do is better, faster, and more power-efficient than the brain. For example, a calculator crunches numbers more energy-efficiently than any human. Yet AI models are a thousand times less efficient than the brain. These models use artificial neural networks (ANNs) and require GPUs for the multiplication of huge matrices. In contrast, spiking neural networks (SNNs) of the brain have no matrix multiplication and much smaller energy requirements. This manifesto proposes a framework for thinking about popular AI models in terms of spiking networks and polychronization, and for interpreting spiking activity as nature's way of implementing look-up tables. This offers a way to convert AI models into a novel type of architecture with the promise of a thousandfold improvement in efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/izhikevich/SNN
