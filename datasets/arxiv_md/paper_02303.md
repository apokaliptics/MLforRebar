## Abstract

In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of the Mamba model in the field of bioacoustics. We first pretrain a Mamba-based audio large language model (LLM) on a large corpus of audio data using self-supervised learning. We fine-tune and evaluate BioMamba on the BEANS benchmark, a collection of diverse bioacoustic tasks including classification and detection, and compare its performance and efficiency with multiple baseline models, including AVES, a state-of-the-art Transformer-based model. The results show that BioMamba achieves comparable performance with AVES while consumption significantly less VRAM, demonstrating its potential in this domain.
