## Abstract

To migrate the remarkable successes of Large Language Models (LLMs), the community has made numerous efforts to generalize them to the table reasoning tasks for the widely deployed tabular data. Despite that, in this work, by showing a probing experiment on our proposed StructQA benchmark, we postulate that even the most advanced LLMs (such as GPTs) may still fall short of coping with tabular data. More specifically, the current scheme often simply relies on serializing the tabular data, together with the meta information, then inputting them through the LLMs. We argue that the loss of structural information is the root of this shortcoming. In this work, we further propose TAMO, which bears an ideology to treat the tables as an independent modality integrated with the text tokens. The resulting model in TAMO is a multimodal framework consisting of a hypergraph neural network as the global table encoder seamlessly integrated with the mainstream LLM. Empirical results on various benchmarking datasets, including HiTab, WikiTQ, WikiSQL, FeTaQA, and StructQA, have demonstrated significant improvements on generalization with an average relative gain of 42.65%.
