## Abstract

Deep learning models, particularly Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, are widely used in time series forecasting due to their ability to capture complex temporal dependencies. However, evaluation integrity is often compromised by data leakage, a methodological flaw in which input-output sequences are constructed before dataset partitioning, allowing future information to unintentionally influence training. This study investigates the impact of data leakage on performance, focusing on how validation design mediates leakage sensitivity. Three widely used validation techniques (2-way split, 3-way split, and 10-fold cross-validation) are evaluated under both leaky (pre-split sequence generation) and clean conditions, with the latter mitigating leakage risk by enforcing temporal separation during data splitting prior to sequence construction. The effect of leakage is assessed using RMSE Gain, which measures the relative increase in RMSE caused by leakage, computed as the percentage difference between leaky and clean setups. Empirical results show that 10-fold cross-validation exhibits RMSE Gain values of up to 20.5% at extended lag steps. In contrast, 2-way and 3-way splits demonstrate greater robustness, typically maintaining RMSE Gain below 5% across diverse configurations. Moreover, input window size and lag step significantly influence leakage sensitivity: smaller windows and longer lags increase the risk of leakage, whereas larger windows help reduce it. These findings underscore the need for configuration-aware, leakage-resistant evaluation pipelines to ensure reliable performance estimation.
