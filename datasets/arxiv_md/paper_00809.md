## Abstract

We introduce gridfm-datakit-v1, a Python library for generating realistic and diverse Power Flow (PF) and Optimal Power Flow (OPF) datasets for training Machine Learning (ML) solvers. Existing datasets and libraries face three main challenges: (1) lack of realistic stochastic load and topology perturbations, limiting scenario diversity; (2) PF datasets are restricted to OPF-feasible points, hindering generalization of ML solvers to cases that violate operating limits (e.g., branch overloads or voltage violations); and (3) OPF datasets use fixed generator cost functions, limiting generalization across varying costs. gridfm-datakit addresses these challenges by: (1) combining global load scaling from real-world profiles with localized noise and supporting arbitrary N-k topology perturbations to create diverse yet realistic datasets; (2) generating PF samples beyond operating limits; and (3) producing OPF data with varying generator costs. It also scales efficiently to large grids (up to 10,000 buses). Comparisons with OPFData, OPF-Learn, PGLearn, and PF$Δ$ are provided. Available on GitHub at https://github.com/gridfm/gridfm-datakit under Apache 2.0 and via `pip install gridfm-datakit`.
