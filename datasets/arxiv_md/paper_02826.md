## Abstract

This volume presents the proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Knowledge, Information and Creativity Support Systems (KICSS 2025), held in Nagaoka, Japan, on December 3-5, 2025. The conference, organized in cooperation with the IEICE Proceedings Series, provides a multidisciplinary forum for researchers in artificial intelligence, knowledge engineering, human-computer interaction, and creativity support systems. The proceedings include peer-reviewed papers accepted through a double-blind review process. Selected papers have been recommended for publication in IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems after an additional peer-review process.
