## Abstract

This paper presents the Nemosine Framework, a modular cognitive architecture designed to support assisted reasoning, structured thinking, and systematic analysis. The model operates through functional cognitive modules ("personas") that organize tasks such as planning, evaluation, cross-checking, and narrative synthesis. The framework combines principles from metacognition, distributed cognition, and modular cognitive systems to offer an operational structure for assisted problem-solving and decision support. The architecture is documented through formal specification, internal consistency criteria, and reproducible structural components. The goal is to provide a clear conceptual basis for future computational implementations and to contribute to the study of symbolic-modular architectures for reasoning.
