## Abstract

The Science Consultant Agent is a web-based Artificial Intelligence (AI) tool that helps practitioners select and implement the most effective modeling strategy for AI-based solutions. It operates through four core components: Questionnaire, Smart Fill, Research-Guided Recommendation, and Prototype Builder. By combining structured questionnaires, literature-backed solution recommendations, and prototype generation, the Science Consultant Agent accelerates development for everyone from Product Managers and Software Developers to Researchers. The full pipeline is illustrated in Figure 1.
