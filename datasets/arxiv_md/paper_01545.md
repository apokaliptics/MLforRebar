## Abstract

Craig interpolation and uniform interpolation have many applications in knowledge representation, including explainability, forgetting, modularization and reuse, and even learning. At the same time, many relevant knowledge representation formalisms do in general not have Craig or uniform interpolation, and computing interpolants in practice is challenging. We have a closer look at two prominent knowledge representation formalisms, description logics and logic programming, and discuss theoretical results and practical methods for computing interpolants.
