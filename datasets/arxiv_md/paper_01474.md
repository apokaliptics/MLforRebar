## Abstract

We present a geometric framework for policy-constrained semantic interpretation that provably prevents hallucinated commitments in high-stakes domains. Semantic meaning is represented as direction on a unit sphere, evidence is modeled as sets of witness vectors, and admissible interpretations correspond to spherical convex regions. Policy constraints are introduced as explicit priors defined over the same manifold, separated from evidence geometry. Interpretation reduces to constrained optimization over admissible regions, with refusal emerging as a topologically necessary outcome under contradiction or policy exclusion. We connect this framework to information theory, Bayesian inference, and sheaf-theoretic semantics, proving that our complexity bounds are information-theoretically optimal. Empirical validation on large scale regulated financial data demonstrates zero hallucinated approvals across multiple policy regimes-the first such result at scale.
