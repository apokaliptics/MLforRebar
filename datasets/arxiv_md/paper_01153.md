## Abstract

Knowledge Graphs (KGs), thanks to their concise and efficient triple-based structure, have been widely applied in intelligent question answering, recommender systems and other domains. However, the heterogeneous and multifaceted nature of real-world data inevitably renders the distribution of relations long-tailed, making it crucial to complete missing facts with limited samples. Previous studies mainly based on metric matching or meta learning, yet they either fail to fully exploit neighborhood information in graph or overlook the distributional characteristics of contrastive signals. In this paper, we re-examine the problem from a perspective of generative representation and propose a few-shot knowledge graph completion framework that integrates two-stage attention triple enhancer with U-KAN based diffusion model. Extensive experiments on two public datasets show that our method achieve new state-of-the-art results.
