## Abstract

Error Span Detection (ESD) extends automatic machine translation (MT) evaluation by localizing translation errors and labeling their severity. Current generative ESD methods typically use Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) decoding, assuming that the model-estimated probabilities are perfectly correlated with similarity to the human annotation, but we often observe higher likelihood assigned to an incorrect annotation than to the human one. We instead apply Minimum Bayes Risk (MBR) decoding to generative ESD. We use a sentence- or span-level similarity function for MBR decoding, which selects candidate hypotheses based on their approximate similarity to the human annotation. Experimental results on the WMT24 Metrics Shared Task show that MBR decoding significantly improves span-level performance and generally matches or outperforms MAP at the system and sentence levels. To reduce the computational cost of MBR decoding, we further distill its decisions into a model decoded via greedy search, removing the inference-time latency bottleneck.
