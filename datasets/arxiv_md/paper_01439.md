## Abstract

A new fuzzy optimization framework that extends FCM causality is proposed. This model utilizes the dynamics to map data into metrics and create a framework that examines logical implication and hierarchy of concepts using a multiplex. Moreover, this is a white-theoretical paper introducing the framework and analyzing the logic and math behind it. Upon this extension the main objectives and the orientation of this framework is expounded and exemplified; this framework is meant for service optimization of information transmission in service process design. Lastly, a thorough analysis of the FHM is included which is done following the logical steps in a simple and elegant manner.
