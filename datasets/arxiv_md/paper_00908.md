## Abstract

Music Emotion Recogniser (MER) research faces challenges due to limited high-quality annotated datasets and difficulties in addressing cross-track feature drift. This work presents two primary contributions to address these issues. Memo2496, a large-scale dataset, offers 2496 instrumental music tracks with continuous valence arousal labels, annotated by 30 certified music specialists. Annotation quality is ensured through calibration with extreme emotion exemplars and a consistency threshold of 0.25, measured by Euclidean distance in the valence arousal space. Furthermore, the Dual-view Adaptive Music Emotion Recogniser (DAMER) is introduced. DAMER integrates three synergistic modules: Dual Stream Attention Fusion (DSAF) facilitates token-level bidirectional interaction between Mel spectrograms and cochleagrams via cross attention mechanisms; Progressive Confidence Labelling (PCL) generates reliable pseudo labels employing curriculum-based temperature scheduling and consistency quantification using Jensen Shannon divergence; and Style Anchored Memory Learning (SAML) maintains a contrastive memory queue to mitigate cross-track feature drift. Extensive experiments on the Memo2496, 1000songs, and PMEmo datasets demonstrate DAMER's state-of-the-art performance, improving arousal dimension accuracy by 3.43%, 2.25%, and 0.17%, respectively. Ablation studies and visualisation analyses validate each module's contribution. Both the dataset and source code are publicly available.
