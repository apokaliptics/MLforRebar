## Abstract

This document reports the sequence of practices and methodologies implemented during the Big Data course. It details the workflow beginning with the processing of the Epsilon dataset through group and individual strategies, followed by text analysis and classification with RestMex and movie feature analysis with IMDb. Finally, it describes the technical implementation of a distributed computing cluster with Apache Spark on Linux using Scala.
