## Abstract

As networks evolve toward 5G Standalone and 6G, operators face orchestration challenges that exceed the limits of static automation and Deep Reinforcement Learning. Although Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a path toward intent-based networking, they introduce stochastic risks, including topology hallucinations and policy non-compliance. To mitigate this, we propose Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC), a neuro-symbolic framework that constrains probabilistic planning with deterministic verification. The architecture relies on a Governance Triad - a telecom-adapted agent (TSLAM-4B), a Network Knowledge Graph (NKG), and SHACL constraints. We evaluated G-SPEC on a simulated 450-node 5G Core, achieving zero safety violations and a 94.1% remediation success rate, significantly outperforming the 82.4% baseline. Ablation analysis indicates that NKG validation drives the majority of safety gains (68%), followed by SHACL policies (24%). Scalability tests on topologies ranging from 10K to 100K nodes demonstrate that validation latency scales as $O(k^{1.2})$ where $k$ is subgraph size. With a processing overhead of 142ms, G-SPEC is viable for SMO-layer operations.
