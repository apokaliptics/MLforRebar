## Abstract

Knowledge Graph Question Answering (KGQA) has traditionally focused on entity-centric queries that return a single answer entity. However, real-world queries are often relational, seeking to understand how entities are associated. In this work, we introduce relation-centric KGQA, a complementary setting where the answer is a subgraph capturing the semantic connections among entities rather than an individual entity. The main challenge lies in the abundance of candidate subgraphs, where trivial or overly common connections often obscure the identification of unique and informative answers. To tackle this, we propose UniRel-R1, a unified framework that integrates subgraph selection, multi-stage graph pruning, and an LLM fine-tuned with reinforcement learning. The reward function is designed to encourage compact and specific subgraphs with more informative relations and lower-degree intermediate entities. Extensive experiments show that UniRel-R1 achieves significant gains in connectivity and reward over Vanilla baselines and generalizes effectively to unseen entities and relations.
