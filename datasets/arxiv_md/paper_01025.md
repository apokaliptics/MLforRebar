## Abstract

Artificial intelligence (AI) systems are being readily and rapidly adopted, increasingly permeating critical domains: from consumer platforms and enterprise software to networked systems with embedded agents. While this has unlocked potential for human productivity gains, the attack surface has expanded accordingly: threats now span content safety failures (e.g., harmful or deceptive outputs), model and data integrity compromise (e.g., poisoning, supply-chain tampering), runtime manipulations (e.g., prompt injection, tool and agent misuse), and ecosystem risks (e.g., orchestration abuse, multi-agent collusion). Existing frameworks such as MITRE ATLAS, National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) AI 100-2 Adversarial Machine Learning (AML) taxonomy, and OWASP Top 10s for Large Language Models (LLMs) and Agentic AI Applications provide valuable viewpoints, but each covers only slices of this multi-dimensional space.
  This paper presents Cisco's Integrated AI Security and Safety Framework ("AI Security Framework"), a unified, lifecycle-aware taxonomy and operationalization framework that can be used to classify, integrate, and operationalize the full range of AI risks. It integrates AI security and AI safety across modalities, agents, pipelines, and the broader ecosystem. The AI Security Framework is designed to be practical for threat identification, red-teaming, risk prioritization, and it is comprehensive in scope and can be extensible to emerging deployments in multimodal contexts, humanoids, wearables, and sensory infrastructures. We analyze gaps in prevailing frameworks, discuss design principles for our framework, and demonstrate how the taxonomy provides structure for understanding how modern AI systems fail, how adversaries exploit these failures, and how organizations can build defenses across the AI lifecycle that evolve alongside capability advancements.
