## Abstract

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems increasingly assume consequential decision-making roles, a widening gap has emerged between technical capabilities and institutional accountability. Ethical guidance alone is insufficient to counter this challenge; it demands architectures that embed governance into the execution fabric of the ecosystem. This paper presents the Ten Criteria for Trustworthy Orchestration AI, a comprehensive assurance framework that integrates human input, semantic coherence, audit and provenance integrity into a unified Control-Panel architecture. Unlike conventional agentic AI initiatives that primarily focus on AI-to-AI coordination, the proposed framework provides an umbrella of governance to the entire AI components, their consumers and human participants. By taking aspiration from international standards and Australia's National Framework for AI Assurance initiative, this work demonstrates that trustworthiness can be systematically incorporated (by engineering) into AI systems, ensuring the execution fabric remains verifiable, transparent, reproducible and under meaningful human control.
