## Abstract

Large language model (LLM) reinforcement learning has increasingly relied on group-based policy optimization frameworks, such as GRPO and GSPO, to achieve stable fine-tuning at scale. However, a fundamental trade-off persists between optimization granularity and training stability. While GSPO improves robustness via sequence-level optimization, its monolithic treatment of sequences introduces severe inefficiencies: its conservative clipping mechanism indiscriminately discards valid training samples-a phenomenon we term gradient underutilization-and its uniform credit assignment fails to capture the heterogeneous contributions of critical reasoning steps. In this work, we propose Entropy Importance Sampling Policy Optimization (ESPO), a novel framework that reconciles fine-grained control with training stability. ESPO decomposes sequences into groups based on predictive entropy, enabling (1) Entropy-driven Importance Sampling to capture intra-sequence heterogeneity, and (2) Entropy-adaptive Clipping to dynamically allocate trust regions based on model uncertainty. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ESPO not only accelerates convergence but also achieves state-of-the-art performance, notably improving accuracy on the challenging HMMT benchmark from 4.4% to 13.13%.
