## Abstract

Bilevel optimization minimizes an objective function, defined by an upper-level problem whose feasible region is the solution of a lower-level problem. We study the oracle complexity of finding an $ε$-stationary point with first-order methods when the upper-level problem is nonconvex and the lower-level problem is strongly convex. Recent works (Ji et al., ICML 2021; Arbel and Mairal, ICLR 2022; Chen el al., JMLR 2025) achieve a $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(κ^4 ε^{-2})$ upper bound that is near-optimal in $ε$. However, the optimal dependency on the condition number $κ$ is unknown. In this work, we establish a new $Ω(κ^2 ε^{-2})$ lower bound and $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(κ^{7/2} ε^{-2})$ upper bound for this problem, establishing the first provable gap between bilevel problems and minimax problems in this setup. Our lower bounds can be extended to various settings, including high-order smooth functions, stochastic oracles, and convex hyper-objectives: (1) For second-order and arbitrarily smooth problems, we show $Ω(κ_y^{13/4} ε^{-12/7})$ and $Ω(κ^{17/10} ε^{-8/5})$ lower bounds, respectively. (2) For convex-strongly-convex problems, we improve the previously best lower bound (Ji and Liang, JMLR 2022) from $Ω(κ/\sqrtε)$ to $Ω(κ^{5/4} / \sqrtε)$. (3) For smooth stochastic problems, we show an $Ω(κ^4 ε^{-4})$ lower bound.
