Part 3: Some argue that letter grades and rankings motivate students to perform better, while others believe that they create unnecessary pressure and reduce the joy of learning. Discuss both views and give your opinion.

In the educational landscape, it is irrefutable that grading and ranking have consistently been a method to evaluate school attendees’ performance. While several individuals insist that such an assessment system incentivises students to excel, others believe that marks and academic standings render learning tedious and produce excessive stress. In this essay, I will expand on both perspectives and their pertinence to my own viewpoint.

On the one hand, proponents advocate the current evaluation system as a catalyst for learners to bolster academic achievements. To commence with, marks and positions can provide concrete feedback on students’ academic competence. Consequently, students can recognise their mistakes and endeavour to enhance their grades in subsequent tests. In other words, a marking and ranking system allows students to substantially boost their performance in incompetent fields. Without such evaluations, students may lack a clear direction or drive to achieve excellence. Moreover, such a system enables students to push themselves to the limit and also fosters a healthy sense of competition. To elucidate, students already at the highest grade or ranking will attempt to maintain and solidify their position, while others will strive to surpass them. This competitive atmosphere can motivate students to work harder, study more effectively, and achieve better academic success.

On the other hand, it is crucial to recognise the negative implications of conventional evaluation methods. Initially, the constant focus on solely achieving outstanding academic accomplishments can undoubtedly breed unhealthy levels of stress. Students may feel overwhelmed by the expectations and incessant demand to keep pace with their peers; this can negatively impact their mental health and overall well-being. Furthermore, when students are primarily motivated by the fear of poor grades or falling behind their peers, education can become a burdensome chore rather than a pleasant and enriching experience.

Admittedly, this pressure can stifle creativity, as students may prioritise rote memorisation over genuine understanding to secure better grades. However, in my opinion, while letter grades and rankings can serve as useful tools for motivation and performance measurement, they should not be the particular focus of education. I believe that a balanced approach that incorporates both qualitative and quantitative feedback is essential. For instance, combining letter grades with personalised feedback can help students understand their strengths and areas for growth without feeling defined or demotivated by a single letter or rank. Additionally, it is imperative to create a learning environment that values effort, creativity, and curiosity to help mitigate the negative effects of excessive pressure.

In conclusion, although there exist sound arguments for the conventional assessment system, the detrimental effects of insurmountable stress and diminished joy of studying are prevalent. Accordingly, a nuanced approach incorporating qualitative and quantitative evaluations, coupled with a diversified concentration on creative fields, is crucial for fostering an educational and engaging learning environment.
