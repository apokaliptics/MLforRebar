**Some people think that the increasing use of computers and mobile phones in communication has negative effects on young people’s reading and writing skills. To what extent do you agree or disagree?**

In contemporary society, the increasing influence of technological devices for communication in the young generation is undeniable. Some people are concerned that this increased digital engagement can impair their literacy capabilities. From my perspective, I partially agree with this notion and this essay will provide pertinent examples to substantiate my viewpoint.

On the one hand, excessive screen time can be detrimental to the youth’s reading and writing competence in various ways. To commence with, the constant stream of short, easily digestible content offered by digital platforms can foster a preference for brevity over in-depth analysis. For instance, TikTok, a social media and entertainment platform, has been at the forefront of this development. Indeed, the current generation is suffering from a diminished attention span due to such recreational applications. Moreover, the prevalence of informal language, abbreviations and obscure vocabulary in digital communication may erode formal literacy skills. For instance, the excessive use of abbreviations like "lol" and "brb" in text messages and social media posts can hinder students' ability to construct grammatically correct and coherent sentences in formal writing.

On the other hand, it is equally important to recognise the potential benefits of technology for literacy development. Initially, computers and mobile devices provide unprecedented access to information and educational resources. Undeniably, online libraries, educational apps, and interactive learning platforms available on such devices can enhance reading comprehension and critical thinking skills. Additionally, digital communication encourages frequent writing practice, which can be seen through daily texting, though in a less formal manner. In fact, when engaging in messages, young people have the opportunity to boost their creative and writing skills, as well as their cognitive function by strategising their responses.

In my opinion, by effectively utilising the potentials of novel technological gadgets and eschewing the pitfalls, these devices can serve as a catalyst for enhancing young people's literacy skills. By fostering a balanced and critical approach to technology, we can empower the younger generation to become proficient and versatile communicators.

In conclusion, while the excessive use of digital platforms can undoubtedly have certain repercussions for young people's literacy skills, it is equally paramount to recognise the potential benefits of technology and utilise such immense capabilities.
