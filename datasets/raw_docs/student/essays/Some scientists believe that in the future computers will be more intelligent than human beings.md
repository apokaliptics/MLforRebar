**Some scientists believe that in the future computers will be more intelligent than human beings. While some see this as a positive development others worry about the negative consequences. Discuss both views and give your opinion.**

Regarding the constant innovations in technology, including computers, it is justifiable for some scientists to ponder a future where artificial intelligence surpasses human intellect. While some perceive this as a beneficial progression, others express concerns around the potential repercussions. In this essay, I will discuss both viewpoints and present my own perspective with pertinent examples to substantiate it.

On the one hand, proponents of superior artificial intelligence argue that such a development can benefit humanity in several ways. To commence with, computers are programmed to be devoid of human error and limitations. Consequently, revolutions in medicine or engineering can be expedited with intricate precisions. In fact, numerous current medical machinery, including X-ray machines or CT scans have incorporated computers to assist them in detecting anomalies. Moreover, the integration of automation for mundane industrial activities, namely car manufacturing or food production, can encourage more individuals to work in tasks requiring human intervention. For instance, engineers can utilise automations to do repetitive tasks, especially quality control, while they can focus on designing innovative products.

On the other hand, there are significant drawbacks to the potential surpassing of human capabilities by computer intelligence. Initially, as AI systems become increasingly sophisticated, it is uncertain whether humans can effectively control or harness the exceptional intelligence of future computers. Indeed, contemporary society has raised concerns about the development of artificial intelligence and its potential to become sentient. Furthermore, a major issue arising from the integration of superintelligent computers is the potential for widespread unemployment. By implementing computers in manufacturing jobs, a substantial number of people doing repetitive tasks would be jobless. Additionally, the development of self-driving vehicles and self-checking out systems have particularly damaged the job market.

From my perspective, the development of artificial intelligence presents both immense opportunities and significant challenges. While the potential benefits in fields like medicine and engineering are undeniable, the risks associated with job displacement and loss of control cannot be ignored. To mitigate such risks, it is paramount for authorities and private companies to develop strategies for retraining the workforce and creating new job opportunities to counter the emergence of highly intelligent computers.

In conclusion, the development of artificial intelligence is a double-edged sword. While it holds the potential to revolutionise various fields and improve human life, it also poses significant challenges, particularly in terms of job displacement and ethical concerns. Accordingly, certain approaches are required to harness capable artificial intelligence and ensure that AI serves as a tool for positive transformations rather than disturbance in human life.
