Some people think that schools should reward students who show the best academic results, while others believe that it is more important to reward students who show improvements. Discuss both views and state your opinion.

In the modern era, education is one of the significant priorities and students should be given recognition to encourage this trend. It has been suggested that schools should offer bonuses to those who exhibit the highest academic performance, whereas others argue that it is more prudent to commend those who demonstrate significant progress. In this essay, I will analyse both viewpoints and present my perspective with pertinent illustrations to support it.

On the one hand, there is no doubt that it is fundamental to honour students with outstanding educational attainment. To commence with, rewarding high achievers can create a role model for their peers wanting to receive similar benefits. To elucidate, contemporaries have a much better understanding of their flaws. Hence, it makes the process of enhancing the overall academic performance of the school more straightforward. Moreover, this can create a far more competitive and cooperative learning environment for the goals students aspire to achieve. Accordingly, undervalued individuals can be motivated to thrive and reach their full potential.

On the other hand, it is substantial to acknowledge one’s efforts and perseverance in sharpening their grasp of the information. Initially, despite not being the valedictorian, a student’s positive progress can be viewed as a strong ethic and propensity for knowledge accumulation. By appreciating such efforts, the confidence and morale of students can be boosted and create a better predilection for learning. Furthermore, honouring progress can also serve as a motivation for students to continue to strive for improvement. In other words, students feel valued and recognised for their hard work, they are more likely to be engaged and invested in their education.

From my point of view, I believe that it is paramount to give recognition to both excellence and improvement. However, the granted rewards should be predominantly promoting intrinsic motivations, namely praise and recognition, rather than materialistic ones. To explicate, such extrinsic incentives as grades or physical prizes can sometimes backfire as this can instigate a concentration on external validation rather than a genuine interest in learning.

In conclusion, rewarding both parties is cardinal for the betterment of a school. However, I think that there should be some precautions on what the prize will be depending on the degree of the achievement and enhancement, coupled with the consideration of the rewards so as not to foster students’ extrinsic motivations.

In contemporary society, the sphere of education holds immense importance, and it is imperative to acknowledge students in order to foster this trend. While some individuals advocate for schools to provide incentives to students who demonstrate outstanding academic performance, others opine that it is more crucial to commend those who exhibit substantial improvements. In this essay, I will examine both perspectives and present my stance with relevant examples to substantiate it. On one hand, it is undeniable that recognizing students with exemplary academic accomplishments is pivotal. Firstly, rewarding high achievers can serve as a source of inspiration for their peers who aspire to achieve similar success. For instance, when students have successful role models, they are more likely to identify areas for improvement and strive for academic excellence themselves. Additionally, this approach can foster a more competitive and collaborative learning environment, thereby motivating underperforming individuals to work towards reaching their full potential. On the other hand, it is important to acknowledge the efforts and perseverance of students who have shown significant progress in their academic endeavors. Regardless of not being the top performer, a student's positive development can be viewed as a commendable work ethic and an inclination towards knowledge acquisition. By acknowledging such efforts, students' confidence and morale can be bolstered, leading to a stronger inclination towards learning. Furthermore, rewarding progress can serve as a catalyst for students to continue striving for improvement, fostering a sense of value and recognition for their hard work, ultimately leading to greater student engagement in their education. From my perspective, I believe that it is crucial to recognize both excellence and improvement. However, the rewards provided should primarily aim to promote intrinsic motivations such as praise and recognition, rather than materialistic ones. Extraneous incentives, such as grades or physical prizes, may inadvertently shift the focus towards external validation rather than fostering a genuine interest in learning. In conclusion, it is imperative to acknowledge both ends of the spectrum for the enhancement of a school's academic environment. Nonetheless, careful consideration should be given to the type and extent of rewards in order to avoid fostering extrinsic motivations among students.
