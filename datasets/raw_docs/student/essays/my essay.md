Part 1.

The extract discusses the pitfalls associated with landfills, despite being the most popular waste disposal method in Britain. Firstly, the previously ample and affordable land is constantly depleting, causing the proliferation of operating cost and scarcity, coupled with the demand for alternative solutions. Secondly, the spillage of acids and detrimental substances from landfills can pose environmental risks. While dated dumping yards relied on rain to disperse toxic substances, this occurrence was infrequent, causing the contamination of its surroundings. However, modern locations utilise liners and treatment systems to mitigate this issue. Eventually, the public disturbance from these places is incontrovertible, namely traffic, noise, ashes and malodorous smells. Additionally, although the health risks are unclear, residents in the proximity of landfills often report health issues.

The table illustrates the average yearly pay of workers across various fields in 2004, coupled with the discrepancy from 2003 in percentage. In contrast, the pie chart depicts the proportion of working fields among graduates.

Overall, individuals in the public services sector achieved the most significant salary in 2004, while workers in wholesale and retail trade experienced the greatest proportional increase. Additionally, public services constituted the preponderance of graduates’ labouring domains.

Upon closer inspection, in 2004 the public sector employees had the highest annual compensation at 92000, reflecting a 3.7% growth from the previous year. Following closely were finance and transportation workers with an average salary of 83000 and 81000, respectively. While the finance sector experienced a 2.9% pay rise, the transportation domain saw a 4.5% increase in salary. Meanwhile, there was notable salary growth in the wholesale and retail trade, surpassing that of the transportation sector by almost double, resulting in employees earning 77000 per year in 2004. Besides, manufacturing and agricultural workers had average salaries of roughly 52000 and 40000, respectively, with more modest growth rates of 4% and 2.31%.

Regarding the pie chart, it is revealed that public service employed the largest proportion of graduates, registering 30%. Manufacturing closely followed, constituting one-fifth of graduates. Noticeably, agriculture, despite offering the lowest salaries, attracted a quarter of the total share of graduates. Wholesale and retail, as well as transportation, each represented one-tenth of graduates, while finance had the smallest proportion at about 5%.

*Most countries aim to improve their standard of living through economic development, but many important social values can be lost as a result*.

**Do the advantages of economic development outweigh the disadvantages?**

The pursuit of economic development has been a cornerstone of national policies worldwide, enhancing the overall living standard of each respective nation. However, this progression can be a causative factor in the diminishment of crucial cultural norms. In this essay, I will discuss both the merits and demerits of economic development and present my stance on the matter.

On the one hand, the advancement of the economy can offer tangible advantages by providing ample resources, contributing to an enhanced standard of living. To commence with, individuals with firm financial foundations can satisfy not only their fundamental requirements such as nourishment and housing, while allocating surplus budget to recreational activities. Indeed, an improvement in the economic sector can impact the general public living standard, both physically and psychiatrically. Moreover, increased taxation will allow governments to invest in essential public services, namely education and healthcare. Indubitably, certain infrastructures, with sufficient funding, can significantly improve the overall quality of life.

On the other hand, the rapid pace of economic development can have detrimental effects on social cohesion and traditional values. Initially, as societies modernise, traditional lifestyles and customs may be marginalised in favour of lucrative allure. In other words, conventional familial bonds can be strained when individuals strive for monetary/pecuniary benefits by prioritising career over personal relationships. This shift often leads to the erosion of long-standing cultural practices, especially in family bonds, as the younger generation may be more inclined to adopt globalised norms that are perceived as more progressive or financially rewarding. Moreover, the aspirations for financial incentives may exacerbate social inequalities. To elucidate, it is uncertain whether prosperity will be equitably distributed among the public, as the immense wealth might be concentrated in a marginal number of people. Consequently, this disparity can breed resentment and tension among different social classes, undermining social cohesion and leading to increased social unrest.

From my perspective, while there are attractive aspects of economic expansion, it is imperative to approach it with caution. Undeniably, the benefits of fiscal growth are substantial, such as improved living standards and better access to essential services. However, these gains should not come at the cost of cultural erosion and social disparity.

In conclusion, while wealth creation may potentially enhance living standards, it takes a heavy toll on society's foundational values. The pursuit of wealth can strain domestic relationships, promote materialism over community, and exacerbate inequalities. Accordingly, the looming drawbacks of economic development, undoubtedly, overshadow the benefits.
