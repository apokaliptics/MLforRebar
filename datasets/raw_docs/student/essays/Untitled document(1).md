The assertion that art's legitimacy hinges solely on its profitability is a contentious viewpoint. In this essay, I will analyse this statement, and present my perspective with pertinent examples to support it.

On the one hand, monetary gain, particularly in today’s market, is an objective measure of artistic quality. Initially, financial viability allows artists to sustain their practice, fostering a thriving artistic ecosystem. To elucidate, pecuniary incentives can bolster one’s efforts into creating majestic artworks. Moreover, the value of a piece of art illustrates its ubiquity and success as it reflects a physical demand for the artwork. Accordingly, this widespread appeal can be interpreted as a measure of an artwork’s success and its ability to resonate with a significant audience scale.

On the other hand, it is imperative to emphasise the subjective and multifaceted nature of art. To commence with, reducing art to its economic value disregards its cultural, historical, and personal significance. Undeniably, several groundbreaking artistic movements initially faced rejection and financial hardship before gaining recognition. Furthermore, focusing solely on profitability can stifle artistic experimentation and innovation. To explicate. artists may feel compelled to cater to popular taste rather than pursue their creative vision, consequently leading to a repetition in trend, impeding novel ideas.

From my perspective, I believe that it is unjustified to solely consider whether art is legitimate depending on its profitability. While monetary incentives may be one minor catalyst in the creation of artworks, art is a mean for individuals to express their personal ideas, without the need for it to be financially successful or not. Additionally, several artworks, despite holding tremendous worth, have not held its initial value due to insufficient recognition and understanding. For instance, NFTs were

In conclusion, while financial success can be a valuable indicator of artistic merit, it should not be the exclusive criterion for determining legitimacy. Art's true value lies in its ability to inspire, challenge, and enrich the human experience, regardless of its commercial viability. By embracing a holistic perspective that considers both artistic and economic factors, we can foster a vibrant and diverse artistic landscape that celebrates creativity in all its forms.
