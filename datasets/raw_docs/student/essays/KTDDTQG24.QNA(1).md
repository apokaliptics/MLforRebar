**Part 3:** With the rise of cryptocurrency and online trading platforms, many people see these opportunities as paths to quick wealth. However, others argue that these trends have also led to an increase in sophisticated scams and financial losses. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.

The emergence of cryptocurrency and virtual trading platforms has prompted several individuals to view these prospects as a means to prosperity. Nonetheless, others believe such tendencies have incurred a surge in complex scamming methods and financial instability. From my perspective, I partially concur with the provided statement, and this essay will present pertinent reasons and examples to substantiate my view.

It is indubitable that cryptocurrency and online trading systems can bolster one’s wealth. To commence with, due to the increased accessibility to trading markets, online platforms have allowed promising investors to examine the market and fund ventures themselves personally. To elucidate, traditional means of investments may require brokers and analysts to safely facilitate financial growth, rendering investing unwelcoming to the public; however, the advent of online trading applications and cryptocurrencies has allowed laypeople to indulge in such financing methods. Furthermore, several trading platforms have incorporated tools for promising investors, allowing informed decisions before financing. For instance, AI-powered data analysis on TradingView, a reputable online marketplace, has saved investors immense time and ensured their potential profits.

However, it is apparent that while virtual currencies and trading markets have incentivised the public to invest, they have also instigated the rise in scams and financial losses. Initially, inexperienced individuals can become victims of fraudulent pecuniary activities, subsequently leading to major losses. One prime example is Mr Pips, by influencing ordinary people to invest in the false stock market, he has swindled approximately 5.2 Trillion VND, whereas others unquestionably had their wealth seized. Moreover, it is unreliable to entirely depend on newly invented tools for investment, since certain platforms can purposefully manipulate the instruments to lure unsuspecting users into poor trades. Additionally, AI-powered services can be erroneous; hence, the overreliance on such inventions can pose potentially adverse outcomes.

In my opinion, with the growing tendency of cryptocurrencies and online trading platforms, it is imperative to adapt to the development and foster crucial digital literacy skills for individuals to eschew the negative implications. By bolstering one’s overall technical competence, the maximum benefits of technological advancements in trading can be reaped.

In conclusion, it is undeniable that the appearance of cryptocurrency and virtual trading platforms has transformed the notion of investing among individuals. Despite several prominent pitfalls, particularly the manifestation of organised scams and financial deficits, I believe that the refinement of people’s digital competence can certainly impede the growth of such malicious phenomena.
