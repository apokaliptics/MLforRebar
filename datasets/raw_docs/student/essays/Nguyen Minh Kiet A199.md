Several individuals believe that the mounting implementation of modern technological gadgets, including mobile phones and computers, for communication is impairing the youth's reading and literacy skills. From my perspective, I thoroughly concur with the given statement and this essay will provide pertinent illustrations to substantiate my viewpoint.

It is an incontrovertible fact that the manifestation of contemporary technological devices has damaged the young generation's proficiency in literacy. To commence with, the rise in the usage of informal language has severely altered the way youngsters recount. To explicate, informal terms that appear online may not be appropriate for writing in formal settings. This is because the parlance that writers use can be a significant factor in establishing their credibility and comprehension of a topic, and informal language, namely abbreviations, slang and memes may be considered unprofessional and ambiguous.=> CÂU DÀI, KHÔNG RÕ Ý This is because the language writers use can affect their credibility and understanding of a topic. Informal language, including abbreviations, slang, and memes, may be seen as unprofessional and unclear." Moreover, the recent proliferation of short-form content has surged a need - ÍT DÙNG - KHÔNG AUTHENTIC to cater to short bursts of attention.=> Moreover, the increasing prevalence of short-form content caters to short attention spans." Such deficiency in attention span can make reading comprehension and writing for a prolonged period arduous for the young.

Furthermore, the dependence on applications, notably autocorrect to fix grammar and typographical errors, can inadvertently hinder youngsters' lexical and grammar development. Take Grammarly as a quintessential example; despite being a reliable tool for correcting grammatical and vocabulary mistakes, the overreliance on such platforms can stifle one's creativity and thoughts in their writing=> HƠI LẠM DỤNG TỪ VỰNG TRONG DIỄN ĐẠT For example, Grammarly is a reliable tool for correcting errors, but relying too heavily on it can stifle creativity in writing. . Consequently, the absence of these advances in real-life situations, namely in academic writing or professional correspondence, can be a formidable- CHƯA PHÙ HỢP obstacle. => The lack of these skills in real-life situations, such as academic writing or professional correspondence, can be a significant obstacle." Additionally, the lack of proper language usage in essential situations can impede critical thinking and analytical skills.

In conclusion, I subscribe to the idea that the burgeoning utilisation of mobile gadgets for communication can negatively predispose literacy competency among young individuals as such modern advancements may prove counterproductive in the numerous scenarios, which are increasingly common in the upcoming generation.
