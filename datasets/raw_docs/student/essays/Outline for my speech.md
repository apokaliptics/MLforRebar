## **Introduction:**

* **Self-introduction:** My name’s Kiet, Nguyen Minh Kiet, currently 17 years old, and recently I just achieved a rather high score in the IELTS test, specifically 8.5 Overall.
* **Overview:** more emphasis on writing.

## **Body:**

The 2 previous speakers have mentioned their tips and strategies on how to tackle Listening and Reading. Now, it is my turn to give you the necessary tips and strategies for the skill that is considered the most challenging among the four, writing.

### **Point 1: The IELTS Landscape:**

First, it is necessary to understand the marking criteria of IELTS Writing. There are four descriptors, “Task Response”, “Coherence and Cohesion”, “Lexical Resource” and “Grammatical Range and Accuracy”. I will further explore these descriptors in each task.

### **Point 2: Analysing a 9.0 score.**

#### **Task 1:**

**Task Achievement**

* All the requirements of the task are fully and appropriately satisfied.
* There may be extremely rare lapses in content.

**Coherence and Cohesion**

* The message can be followed effortlessly.
* Cohesion is used in such a way that it very rarely attracts attention.
* Any lapses in coherence or cohesion are minimal.
* Paragraphing is skillfully managed.

**Lexical Resource**

* Full flexibility and precise use are evident within the scope of the task.
* A wide range of vocabulary is used accurately and appropriately with very natural and sophisticated control of lexical features.
* Minor errors in spelling and word formation are extremely rare and have minimal impact on communication.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy**

* A wide range of structures within the scope of the task is used with full flexibility and control.
* Punctuation and grammar are used appropriately throughout.
* Minor errors are extremely rare and have minimal impact on communication.

**My conclusion:** While it only accounts for ⅓ of the Writing score, it is certainly a difficult part, requiring the test taker to familiarise themselves with several types of graphs, namely bar, pie, mixed, table, etc.

#### **Task 2:**

**Task Response**

* The prompt is appropriately addressed and explored in depth.
* A clear and fully developed position is presented which directly answers the question(s).
* Ideas are relevant, fully extended, and well supported.
* Any lapses in content or support are extremely rare.

**Coherence and Cohesion**

* The message can be followed effortlessly.
* Cohesion is used in such a way that it very rarely attracts attention.
* Paragraphing is skillfully managed.
* Any lapses in coherence or cohesion are minimal.

**Lexical Resource**

* Full flexibility and precise use are widely evident.
* A wide range of vocabulary is used accurately and appropriately with very natural and sophisticated control of lexical features.
* Minor errors in spelling and word formation are extremely rare and have minimal impact on communication.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy**

* A wide range of structures is used with full flexibility and control.
* Punctuation and grammar are used appropriately throughout.
* Minor errors are extremely rare and have minimal impact on communication.

**My conclusion:** I believe that this is the most crucial part (Part 1 is still important) to get a high writing band score since it constitutes ⅔ the overall writing score. We all have critical thinking skills and while writing essays, we can certainly apply such a versatile tool in our inventory to elaborate our personal ideas according to the question. From my experience, while I only got 7 across 4 criteria for task 1, I got 3 9’s and 1 8 on task 2, substantially increasing my score.

### **Point 3: Practical Strategies and common errors**

* **Time management**: It’s important to estimate your writing time, and try to simulate the testing environment if possible, this way you can identify your strengths and weaknesses, easily distributing your time. For me, my greatest advantage is Task 2, due to my lexical range and ability to formulate ideas quickly, therefore, I mostly focus on enhancing my essay, though it is still vital to maintain a steady and safe score in Task 1. On my test, I allocated around 40 minutes for my essay and 15 minutes for my Task 1, every part had 3-4 minutes of preparation and note-taking before I began writing. My last 5 minutes are to look for grammatical errors or whether I made a typo during my writing session, it’s really precious since I managed to refine my writing even more.
* **Effective note-taking skills**: Some people do not write a basic outline before writing. I believe that this is a big issue among IELTS takers, since the majority do not want to waste time. However, for task 1, by evaluating the information beforehand, the process of writing would be much smoother and faster. Likewise, writing outlines consisting of your main ideas and idea development would enable you to write much faster. Sacrificing 3-5 minutes to save 10-15 minutes is well, obviously more advantageous.
* **Bombardment of advanced vocabulary and awkward usage:** I’ve witnessed several people learning numerous advanced or C2 vocabulary and try to apply them immediately. It is not a bad thing, however, the constant usage of formal or C2 lexical resources can certainly impede the overall flow of the essay. Maybe 2-3 advanced words in one sentence is enough to showcase your vocabulary. Moreover, some attempt to use advanced vocabulary without fully understanding its meaning and usage, leading to awkward or completely wrong usage. To fix this issue, it’s important to consult your IELTS teacher or someone with high English proficiency before applying it onto your writing.
