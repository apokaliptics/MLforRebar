Several individuals believe that the authorities should refrain from investing in the construction of theatres and sports stadiums and allocate more money to medical and educational aspects. I partially concur with this statement, and this essay will provide pertinent illustrations to substantiate my view.

On the one hand, numerous benefits are prevalent in the investment in healthcare and schooling. To commence with, these essential services lay the firm foundation for the community. In other words, a healthy and well-educated population is a nation's most valuable asset. Accordingly, by funding healthcare programmes and education, the authorities are investing in a productive and intelligent future workforce. Moreover, the absence of medical attention and academics can impede the effectiveness of constructing entertainment facilities. For instance, someone with an inadequate understanding of music could not fully comprehend the complexity and difficulty of specific compositions. Additionally, individuals with deteriorating health may need help to approach these recreational locations.

On the other hand, there are compelling arguments in favour of investing in recreational facilities such as theatres and sports stadiums. Initially, these venues can generate substantial economic benefits. For instance, hosting major events like the Euro 2024 football championship can significantly boost a nation's economy through ticket sales, tourism, and increased spending in local businesses. Moreover, theatres and stadiums can contribute to a city's cultural vibrancy and international reputation, attracting visitors and fostering a sense of community.

In conclusion, I believe that there should be a balanced and adequate investment in both sectors, as they are equally paramount to society. While healthcare and education offer long-term benefits for a nation's development, the benefits of promoting arts and culture cannot be understated. They contribute to the national identity of a country, alongside offering attractive financial merits. By acknowledging the importance of both, we can ensure a well-rounded and prosperous society.

There is a divergence of opinions on whether the authorities are the sole force capable of instigating substantial modifications to the fabric of society or even an individual can profoundly influence the community. From my perspective, the government plays the pivotal role in influencing society; however, the impact of certain individuals remains considerable.

It is indubitable that the government holds immense power and possesses the ability to integrate crucial changes. To commence with, the authorities are the only power able to enact laws and implement particular policies. For instance, several policies, namely the Civil Rights Act and stimulus packages are government-based programmes contributing to the transformation of society. Moreover, it is the government’s responsibility to protect the welfare of its citizens by providing essential services such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure. Without government intervention, there would be chaos and inequality, making it imperative for the government to uphold justice and maintain order within the society. Take the Great Depression as a quintessence, U.S President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his advisors were incontrovertibly essential for the revitalisation of the economy.

However, it is inaccurate to understate the significant impact that an individual can make. Initially, in the past, there have been instances where singular actions have sparked overwhelming shifts. One archetype is Martin Luther King Jr., he is an American activist who had led several civil rights movements. Without his incredible leadership, the path to equality among races might have been significantly more challenging and violent. Furthermore, not only politics, several individuals have contributed to shaping our contemporary society through their respective inventions and discoveries. From Thomas Edison’s light bulb to Steve Job’s ingenious idea of the modern smartphone, inarguably, individuals have been at the forefront of societal development.

In conclusion,
