Essay:

*(image removed)*In recent years, the idea of reducing the working week and extending the weekend has gained attention. In my opinion, I agree with this point.

On the one hand, it is undeniable that some industries may struggle to implement a shorter workweek due to operational demands. Firstly, if employees take extended time off, the company may face a shortage of manpower, leading to delays and decreased efficiency. Secondly, reducing working hours can lower employees’ commitment and dedication to the company, as they may not have enough time to complete tasks thoroughly.

On the other hand, a longer weekend can benefit workers’ mental and physical health. Many employees experience stress and burnout due to long working hours, leaving little time for family, hobbies, or relaxation. For instance, countries like Iceland have adopted a four-day workweek with positive results, such as reduced stress and higher job satisfaction. More time to rest can lead to improved well-being, which benefits both workers and employers in the long run. Additionally, working fewer days can enhance productivity. Research shows that people tend to work more efficiently when they have shorter hours to complete their tasks. For example, Microsoft Japan conducted a four-day workweek trial and reported a 40% increase in productivity. This suggests that focusing on quality over quantity can lead to better outcomes in the workplace.

In conclusion, a shorter working week can bring many advantages, including better health and higher efficiency. However, practical challenges in certain industries must be addressed before it can be widely adopted in the long term.

My version:

It is insisted that the duration of the working week be reduced, coupled with an extended weekend length for the workforce. From my perspective, I concur with the provided statement, and this essay will present pertinent examples to substantiate my view.

Indubitably, several benefits are apparent in the implementation of a shorter workweek. To commence with, an abbreviated working week can allow workers to sustain high performance. Meanwhile, intense and constant working sessions can undoubtedly result in burnout, increasing the likelihood of errors. For instance, NVIDIA, an American corporation specialising in computers, coerces several employees to work for an entire week, up to 2 AM every day. Consequently, numerous individuals reported being heavily affected physically and emotionally; this negative trend can progress into a decline in job satisfaction and productivity. Incorporating a shorter workweek certainly prevents overworking, ultimately fostering a healthy and efficacious working environment.

Additionally, a lengthened weekend allows a full recovery from a tiring week of working, as individuals can engage in joyous activities without feeling rushed. Besides, a longer weekend undoubtedly extends the array of activities individuals can participate in. Considering the extensive time and activities to choose from, it is undeniable that workers can be more rejuvenated and motivated to tackle the challenges of the upcoming work time. For example, families can spend quality time together, strengthening bonds that might otherwise weaken due to demanding work schedules. Similarly, individuals can pursue hobbies, engage in physical exercise, or attend educational courses, contributing to their personal growth and overall happiness.

While some critics may argue that a limited working hours can be detrimental to a firm’s financial success, I still firmly believe that such an approach is more advantageous rather than harmful. Take Microsoft Japan as a prime example, the company implemented a four-day work schedule and observed a 40% increase in productivity, along with lower electricity consumption and happier employees, thus indicating that a well-rested and motivated workforce can compensate for reduced hours by working more efficiently and creatively.

In conclusion, despite some unappreciative notions from critics, I believe that a shorter working week, alongside a longer weekend can be beneficial for the individual and the firm’s overall growth.
