**Part 3: Write an essay of 350 words on the following topic**

Companies and people should do charity to benefit the community rather than gaining fame for themselves.

Discuss this statement and give your opinion

The notion that firms and individuals should do charitable work for the well-being of the general public rather than accumulating personal fame is a contentious issue. In this essay, I will discuss the statement and present my perspective with pertinent examples to substantiate it.

Undoubtedly, some companies and people engage in charitable activities with a sole purpose to enhance their reputation or gain recognition. Initially, the ubiquity of a celebrity or a corporate giant can attract immense donations and public interest. Consequently, the local community will receive significant economic boosts from such promotions. Moreover, the publicity surrounding charitable initiatives can ensure the suitable allocation of donated resources. However, in spite of the overall publicity and the assurance of accurate expenditure of donations, it is imperative to recognise the actual values derived from charity, rather than solidifying personal reputation.

To commence with, it is the moral obligation of humans to benefit their local society. Meanwhile, the act of focusing on fame and recognition can distract the true purpose of charitable activities, potentially leading to exploitation and mismanagement of resources. To elucidate, instead of utilising all resources effectively to address underlying problems of the public, firms and individuals may use them to expand the publicity of the local area, aiming to achieve further recognition. Furthermore, excessive concentration on popularity and fame can indubitably undermine the genuine empathy and compassion, which are the core values of charitable works. This negligence in empathetic emotions can render charity efforts superficial, as the goal has been shifted towards corporate gains and recognition.

From my perspective, while fame and recognition may be byproducts of charitable work, they should not be the primary motivation. Undeniably, true charity comes from a desire to make the world a better place, not from a desire for personal or corporate glory. Accordingly, it is paramount to focus on the welfare of the community rather than on gaining fame, as this fosters genuine, long-term change. On the contrary, when charity becomes more about appearances than impact, it loses its essence. For this reason, it is essential that the core of any charitable act remains centred on benefiting the community.

In conclusion, I believe that companies and individuals should engage in charity with the goal of helping others, rather than seeking fame for themselves. While recognition may help amplify certain causes, the intent behind charity must be rooted in altruism to truly create meaningful, positive change in society.
