Traditionally students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. For example globalization affects local economies; therefore, stakeholders must respond.

Consequently students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates a challenge for policymakers. On the other hand students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests greater inequality. Furthermore societal norms have shifted, and this suggests greater inequality. Interestingly students increasingly rely on digital platforms; therefore, policy adjustments may help. Generally students increasingly rely on digital platforms; therefore, we must reassess our strategies. For example public policy influences innovation; therefore, further research is needed.
