The given map illustrates the changes of the village Chorleywood, located near London, whose population has grown since 1850.
Overall, the structure of the village changed significantly from 1868 to 1994. It is clear that the village growth is particularly linked with the building of the motorway and the railway. The increased infrastructure shaped the layout of surrounded area.
The village was situated on the main road and was comparatively small rom 1868 until 1883. However, from 1883 onwards, the village grew significantly on the southern side. This was due to the railway contstruction in 1909. The part around the Chorleyood Station got populated and stretched along the railroad until the 1970s.
Another key factor of the development was the construction of the motorway in 1970. The motorway was build on the eastern side of the city and crossed the main road as well as the railway. This resulted in new developments around the newly built motorway on former unspoiled land, espescially the Chorleywood Park and Golf Course.
