The table indicates the wages of secondary/high school teachers in 2009. It could be seen that Luxembourg has the highest salaries among each group, namely "Starting", "After 15 years" and "Maximum", but there are other properties varying from country to country, such as the ratios between groups and the number of years to reach maximum salary.
It is notable from the table, that in Denmark one could reach maximum salary in only eight years, which is the lower value. For comparison: the highest value is 37 years in Japan.
Another feature is ratio between starting salary and maximum one. In all the considered countries this ratio exceeds one and a half (in Japan and Korea it is even greater than two), except Denmark, where it is approximately equal to 1.2.
The third column is only important for Luxembourg, Japan and Korea, since others have the last column less than 15, and therefore the maximum wage is the same as the wage after 15 years. For the three named countries however, we may analyze the dynamics of salary growth more precisely.
