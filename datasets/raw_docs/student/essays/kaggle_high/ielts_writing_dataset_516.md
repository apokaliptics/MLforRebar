The diagram illustrates the effect of a stopbank in frequently flooded areas.
Overall, a stopbank divides the land from the rive or the drain and contributes to the formation of an internal ponding system on land. Houses can be built lower in areas with a stopbank.
It is clearly shown in the diagram that house floor level in areas without a stopbank must be 300 millimeters above the 100-year flood or ponding level. However, house floor level in areas with a stopbank can be much lower, even under the 100-year flood level. This might result from the fact that the stopbank is high enough to stop water from flooding in.
At the same time, the floodgate and berm under the stopbank connect the internal pond with the river outside. When the internal runoff leads to too much water on land, People can open the floodgate and let the water out into the river or drain.
