The diagram illustrates the process of drinking water production from rainwater in a town in Australia.
Overall, there are five steps involved in producing drinking water for domestic purposes, starting with rainwater collection and ending with drinking water being ready for consumption.
First, rainwater is collected in a tank, which is attached next to houses. This collected water then passes through a drain down to the water filter under the ground where it is purified. Afterwards, such cleaned water travels passing to a large storage tank set up at the lower level before being sent to a water treatment station. At this point, such cleaned water is treated by some chemicals added from the top of the container. Once it has been processed, drinking water passes along a pipe back to the aboveground level where it is then consumed by households. After being used, wastewater passes through the pipe underneath houses to the water filter tank and is combined with rainwater to start the process again.
