The first bar graph illusrates information on the proportions of population in Southeast Asia and Australia receiving water supply in 1990 and 2010. The second bar graph compares the levels of cleanliness of water supplied in these two regions in both these years.
Overall, a higher percentage of the population in both the regions received water supply in 2010 compared to 1990. However, in both the years, people in Australia were supplied with comparitively cleaner water than those in Southeast Asia.
To begin with, nearly 100% of the population in Australia was supplied with water in 2010 compared to 80% in 1990. In contrast, the percentage of popluation in Southeast Asia receiving water supply in 2010 was double (around 80%) that in 1990.
Furthermore, water supplied in Australia in 2010 had a purity level of 80% compared to well above 60% in 1990. Notably, water supplied in Southeast Asia did not differ significantly in its degree of cleanliness. In other words, it had a purity level of approximately 40% in both the years.
