Traditionally technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, further research is needed. Furthermore educational outcomes vary across regions; therefore, further research is needed. Generally students increasingly rely on digital platforms; therefore, further research is needed.

Consequently public policy influences innovation. Consequently students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. Generally students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior. On the other hand students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators.
