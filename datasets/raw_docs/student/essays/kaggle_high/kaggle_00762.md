Traditionally public policy influences innovation, and this suggests a need for better measurement. Interestingly students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior. Consequently public policy influences innovation, which demonstrates a shift in priorities.

On the other hand public policy influences innovation. Generally technology has advanced rapidly, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators. Interestingly globalization affects local economies, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior. Consequently globalization affects local economies. For example educational outcomes vary across regions; therefore, stakeholders must respond. Notably educational outcomes vary across regions, which demonstrates a challenge for policymakers.
