Specifically educational outcomes vary across regions, and this suggests a need for better measurement. Interestingly students increasingly rely on digital platforms.

Interestingly students increasingly rely on digital platforms; therefore, policy adjustments may help. In recent years societal norms have shifted; therefore, policy adjustments may help. Notably educational outcomes vary across regions, and this suggests a reconsideration of values. Consequently students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates a shift in priorities. Consequently students increasingly rely on digital platforms.
