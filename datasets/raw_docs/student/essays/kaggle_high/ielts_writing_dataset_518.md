The diagrams show the plan of a ground level of a house at present and after a presented refurbishment.
The most noticeable changes between the two plans regards the living room, which, in the prospective plan, is widened by removing the internal wall which is placed on the eastern side of the plan, the hall is joined with the living room and the internal doors are displaced at south entrance’s left.
It can also be seen that in the proposed plan, the stairs structure is rearranged in a half circle shape and placed on the north side of the house, propped up onto the western internal wall, whereas in the current plan it stands in the centre hosting a storage underneath.
The kitchen in the projected plan is embellished with a forniture set which surrounds the left wing of the house, although this may cause a shrink in terms of space availability .
In conclusion, the building works of the proposed plan of the ground floor are aimed to change the spatial layout, turning the living room into a full-fledged open space, by relocating the stairs. Amendments are to be made regarding the kitchen furniture, making it more comfortable and enjoyable compared to that of the existing plan.
