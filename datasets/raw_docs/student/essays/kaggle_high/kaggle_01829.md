Consequently students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators. On the other hand societal norms have shifted; therefore, further research is needed. On the other hand technology has advanced rapidly, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators. Traditionally educational outcomes vary across regions, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators. Furthermore public policy influences innovation; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate. Specifically globalization affects local economies, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators.
