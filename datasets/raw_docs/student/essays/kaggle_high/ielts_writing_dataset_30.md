The provided picture illustrates how rain water is reclyced, processed and turned into drinking water in an Australian town.
Overall, information given from the diagram below depicts rain water is collected from the roof of the houses and then it passes through many different steps, each with its specific function, before turning back as drinking water into houses.
In particular, when it rains on steep roofs, water pours down on one side and it is therefore collected by a drain, which leads to a large underground pipe, connecting all houses. Water is then sent to a water filter, which roughly purify water from dust, pebbles and other bigger particles.
Subsequently, water is collected into a giant underground storage, waiting to be sent into the water treatment tank. In there, chemicals are added into the water to make it potable. Finally, drinking water is sent back to houses through a piping system.
