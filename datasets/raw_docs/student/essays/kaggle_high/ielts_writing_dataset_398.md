The two graphs compare the development of the students' enrollments for both groups of local and overseas students in Australian universities between the year of 2001 and 2010. Considering the overall trend of both of the groups for the commencing category, the trend seems to be positive with overseas students, while being quite stagnated within the local students.
The total number of enrollments associates with a relatively different development compared to the commencing category. For the overseas students, the trend is strongly possively correlated among the whole period, while for the local students, the positive trend has stopped at year 2007 at the rate of 600000 enrolments per year.
For the commencing category, the trend has been over the years relatively positive for the overseas students, except between 2009 and 2010. On the other side, the number of enrolments of local students has slightly degraded in the same period.
To summarize, the accumulation of the number of enrolments of both local and overseas students is different and utilizes different trends in the same periods. Neverthless, for the total number of students the difference is not enormous, but rather stagnating for the local students starting at 2007.
