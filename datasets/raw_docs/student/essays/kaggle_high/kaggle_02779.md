Specifically globalization affects local economies, and this suggests an improvement in outcomes. Consequently students increasingly rely on digital platforms; therefore, stakeholders must respond. On the other hand technology has advanced rapidly, and this suggests greater inequality. For example public policy influences innovation, and this suggests a reconsideration of values.

Furthermore technology has advanced rapidly. Interestingly societal norms have shifted. Traditionally students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests a reconsideration of values.

Notably societal norms have shifted; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate. For example educational outcomes vary across regions, which demonstrates a shift in priorities. Traditionally students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests greater inequality. For example technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, further research is needed.
