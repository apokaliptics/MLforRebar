The bar chart sheds light on how employment rates of each gender changed from 1995 to 2005 in six nations: Australia, Switzerland, Iceland, Britain, New Zealand and the United States.
Overall, there are mainly two trends suggested by this diagram. First, the employment rates of males were higher than those of females in both 1995 and 2005 across all six countries. Second, this period witnessed an increase in the employment rates of both genders in all countries.
As shown in this graph, the large gender gap of employment took place in Iceland, Australia and New Zealand where the difference of employment percentage between males and females reached approximately 30% in both 1995 and 2005. In the other countries, the difference was between 10% and 15%.
It is also apparent that an increase of around 10%-15% in employment proportions appeared in each gender across all nations, especially in Australia where the percentage of employed men rose from about 56% to 70% while that of employed women went up from nearly 26% to 38%.
