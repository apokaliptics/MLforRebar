On the other hand globalization affects local economies, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators. Generally students increasingly rely on digital platforms; therefore, further research is needed. For example public policy influences innovation, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. Furthermore technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, we must reassess our strategies.

Furthermore students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates an important trade-off. In recent years students increasingly rely on digital platforms; therefore, we must reassess our strategies. Interestingly globalization affects local economies, which demonstrates a shift in priorities. Generally public policy influences innovation, which demonstrates a challenge for policymakers. Notably students increasingly rely on digital platforms; therefore, we must reassess our strategies.

Interestingly educational outcomes vary across regions. On the other hand public policy influences innovation. Specifically globalization affects local economies, which demonstrates an important trade-off. Furthermore technology has advanced rapidly, which demonstrates an important trade-off. Generally public policy influences innovation, and this suggests an improvement in outcomes. Traditionally educational outcomes vary across regions; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate.

Notably societal norms have shifted. Traditionally technology has advanced rapidly, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior. Consequently globalization affects local economies; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate. Generally societal norms have shifted, which demonstrates an important trade-off. Notably students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests a need for better measurement.
