Specifically globalization affects local economies, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. In recent years students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. Interestingly students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators. For example technology has advanced rapidly. Specifically societal norms have shifted, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior. Furthermore public policy influences innovation; therefore, further research is needed.

Traditionally globalization affects local economies. On the other hand technology has advanced rapidly, which demonstrates a challenge for policymakers. Consequently students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates a shift in priorities. Consequently technology has advanced rapidly, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. Generally technology has advanced rapidly, which demonstrates a challenge for policymakers. Consequently educational outcomes vary across regions, and this suggests a need for better measurement.
