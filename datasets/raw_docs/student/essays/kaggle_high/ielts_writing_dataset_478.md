The diagram shown gives a pictorial view of the process of electricity generation via solar panels for domestic use. The energy is transferred through 5 major points, as shown by the diagram.
Overall, the process starts with energy absorption from the sun. The subsequent stages are followed to generate and distribute electricity in the household, with the last stage being the storage and reuse of stored electricity by the utility grid.
Firstly, the solar panels which have been placed at appropriate locations for receiving sunlight absorb the sun's energy. This energy is converted to DC current, which is in turn converted to AC current by the inverter. This inverter is responsible for production and electricity control.
Afterwards the electricity is transferred to the electrical panel which distributes the acquired electricity throughout the home for use. Not all of the electricity is put into use and this excess is sent through the utility meter to the utility grid for storage. In the event that the household consumption exceeds the amount produced by the solar panel, the utility grid provides electricity through the utility meter to meet the deficit.
