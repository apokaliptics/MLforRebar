The diagram illustrates the way how solar energy can be used as a source of household energy. Overall, the process consists of 5 stages, which implies the use of different devices, namely solar panels, the inverter, the electrical panel, the utility meter and the utility grid. The construction needs the sunlight to be converted into energy afterwards.
First of all, solar panels on the roof of the house absorb the sun energy and transform it into DC current. Next, the DC current is converted into the AC current by going through an inverter, which can also be used as the generated electricity controller.
It is important to note that the electrical panel is used in several ways. First, it distributes the electricity to your home. Second, it is connected to the utility meter that flows back extra solar energy to the grid. Last but not least, if the amount of sunshine is not enough to supply the house with electricity, the utility grid, that is also wired to the panel, provides it in the usual way.
