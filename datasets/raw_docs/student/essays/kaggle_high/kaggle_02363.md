In recent years societal norms have shifted, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators. On the other hand societal norms have shifted. Notably societal norms have shifted; therefore, we must reassess our strategies. Generally students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates a challenge for policymakers. Interestingly technology has advanced rapidly, and this suggests a need for better measurement.

On the other hand students increasingly rely on digital platforms. Consequently technology has advanced rapidly. Specifically educational outcomes vary across regions, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior. On the other hand globalization affects local economies. Furthermore globalization affects local economies, and this suggests a need for better measurement.

Consequently students increasingly rely on digital platforms; therefore, stakeholders must respond. For example educational outcomes vary across regions, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior. Notably students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests an improvement in outcomes. Notably students increasingly rely on digital platforms; therefore, we must reassess our strategies. Consequently students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests greater inequality.

For example students increasingly rely on digital platforms. Consequently globalization affects local economies; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate. Generally societal norms have shifted, and this suggests a reconsideration of values. Generally educational outcomes vary across regions; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate.
