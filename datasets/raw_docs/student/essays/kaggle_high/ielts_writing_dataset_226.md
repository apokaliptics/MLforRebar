Information about the age distribution of the population of France and India is provided in the diagram in percentages.
Overall, in India the older the age group the smaller the portion of the population it is, whereas in France it is a lot more balanced.
Values between the age groups of the population do not differ in France as much as they do in India. For example, people aged between 30 and 35 in France have similiar figures to kids aged between 0 and 5. On the other hand, in India children this age are around double that of the adults between 30 and 35. Another importnat difference is that the diagram provides detailed information about the age structure of the population in India only up to 70 years of age, compared to France's which extends to 85.
It must be noted that in France gender distribution is close to equal for younger people but after 60 years of age females outnumber males greatly, however in India no such trend is noticable.
