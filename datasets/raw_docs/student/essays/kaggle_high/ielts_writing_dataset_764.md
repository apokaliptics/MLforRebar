The diagram illustrates the process of producing carbonated drinks.
There are five main stages of making carbonated drinks (water cleaning, heating evaporation and carbonation, mixing, filtering and filling, packing).
The whole process of producing carbonated drinks begins with raw water, which goes through the water filter. Then, a water softener and some chemicals are added to the filtered water. A pump brings the water to stage 2, where water is heated and then goes through a cooling pipe. After, the water goes through the carbonation process. Then, the carbonated water goes to the mixing stage; meanwhile, the mixing tank adds colouring, syrup and flavour.
Stage 4 is filtering and filling the ready product in the boxes. After mixing, the drink goes through the filter once more and after that is filled in bottles or cans. The final stage is packing, where the product is ready to be shipped to the supermarkent.
