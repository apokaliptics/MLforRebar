Consequently educational outcomes vary across regions. In recent years technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, we must reassess our strategies. Notably students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates an important trade-off. Specifically technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate. For example globalization affects local economies, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior. Traditionally educational outcomes vary across regions.
