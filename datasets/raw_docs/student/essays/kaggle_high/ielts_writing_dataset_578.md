The map shown provides a rough overview of a proposed town structure. There is a clear distinction between residential areas, industries, roads, parking spaces, transport facilities such as buses, and recreational areas.
The diagram is structured in a circular manner, with divisions being made radially. The proposal suggests that the town be arbitrarily divided into an inner and outer ring by a Ring road. Originating from this, are multiple paths in a spoke-like manner. The internal circle has been divided into four regions, not including the central square and the external ring has seven similar parts.
The internal ring consists of two bus stands and parking areas in the middle of the town. Surrounding these lie homes and a few recreational areas interconnected by straight roads.
The outermost part of the map contains the industries, and housing facilities, separated by more lanes. There are two industries, one each on the left upper and right lower corner of the map. These have been provided their own sections distinct from homes, which occupy the other five subdivisions.
