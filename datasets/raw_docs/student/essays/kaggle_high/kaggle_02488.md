Interestingly students increasingly rely on digital platforms. Interestingly technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, we must reassess our strategies.

In recent years students increasingly rely on digital platforms. Consequently public policy influences innovation; therefore, further research is needed. In recent years students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests a reconsideration of values.

For example societal norms have shifted; therefore, stakeholders must respond. For example globalization affects local economies, and this suggests a reconsideration of values. Notably societal norms have shifted; therefore, further research is needed. Generally students increasingly rely on digital platforms. Traditionally technology has advanced rapidly.

On the other hand technology has advanced rapidly. On the other hand technology has advanced rapidly, and this suggests a reconsideration of values. Interestingly students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates an important trade-off.
