Illustrated by the picture is the layout of a park in 1980 as well as the changes till the present time. It can be clearly seen that there are a few similarities but many differences in the two layouts.
In 1980, the rectangular park was walled on all four sides with two gates, one towards the west and one towards the south. An ‘L’ shaped road connected the two gates. A small pond was there between the road and the west wall of the park. There were benches on three sides of the pond. On each side of the road, towards the southeast and southwest were flower beds, with beautiful flowers. In the north east of the park, there was an area full of trees.
A lot of changes can be seen in the present view of the park. The boundary wall has been totally removed. The main road has been extended to the north and the east side. Amidst the trees, some picnic chairs and tables have been placed and people can also enjoy the barbecue over there. The flower area on the southwest has been replaced by a bush, and that on the south east has been replaced by the play ground. The small pond and the benches have not been touched.
Overall, the park has become an open space with no walls and gates.
