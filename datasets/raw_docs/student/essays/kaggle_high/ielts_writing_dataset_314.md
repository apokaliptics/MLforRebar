The bar chart illustrates the quantity of visits by the thousands paid to a community website within the first two years of use.
Overall, there is a greater upward trend from the second year of use compared to the first year of use. In addition to that, in both years the website undergoes a drastic fluctuation in numbers. It can be observed that initially in the month of September, number of visits in the first year of use are lower than second year of use, but numbers of the former subsequently surpasses the latter in the final month of August.
In regards to the first year of use, quantity of visits increases from about 2000 visits in September to 10000 visits within 2 months and remains constant for another month. Following that, numbers plummet from December to February, reaching a low-point of less than approximately 500 visits. The numbers rise gradually from February onwards until it reaches it's highest at 15000 by August.
On the other hand, during the second year of use, the number of visits rises sharply from about 2500 visits to around 17500 visits. Soon, the visits dip to 10000 only by February, persisting to March. The trend then increases steadily until it touches roughly 22500 visits in July, but drops once again to less than 13000.
