The diagram illustrates the difference between parents in four tasks of nighttime childcare in 2022.
Overall, women were significantly more involved with caring for children than their partners. In addition, the attendance rate among these four tasks and parents varied.
Regarding mothers, around 75% engaged with dressing, while half assisted with children's homework. Another roughly 42% prepared for bed, and 25% played games with their kids.
On the other hand, although most fathers cared about their children's homework, the figure was only 10%. Conversely, dressing was the least favorite thing among the four tasks for the fathers; probably just 2% were involved with it while playing games and preparing for bed were equally preferred by 5% of the fathers.
Furthermore, 70% of both parents played games with their kids at night, but the data was nearly halved when it came to homework assistance. The least number of parents engaged with dressing was over 20%; nevertheless, the ratio of preparing for bed almost doubled.
