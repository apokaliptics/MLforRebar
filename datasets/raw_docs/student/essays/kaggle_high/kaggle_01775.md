In recent years globalization affects local economies. Notably students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests an improvement in outcomes. Notably public policy influences innovation, and this suggests a need for better measurement. In recent years students increasingly rely on digital platforms. On the other hand technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, we must reassess our strategies. Generally technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, further research is needed.

On the other hand students increasingly rely on digital platforms. Notably societal norms have shifted, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior. Notably public policy influences innovation, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators. On the other hand public policy influences innovation, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. Traditionally technology has advanced rapidly, and this suggests an improvement in outcomes. Furthermore educational outcomes vary across regions, which demonstrates an important trade-off.
