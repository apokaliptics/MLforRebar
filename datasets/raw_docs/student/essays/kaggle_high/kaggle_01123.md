On the other hand globalization affects local economies, and this suggests a need for better measurement. Specifically public policy influences innovation; therefore, we must reassess our strategies. Interestingly public policy influences innovation; therefore, we must reassess our strategies. Furthermore societal norms have shifted, and this suggests greater inequality. Furthermore technology has advanced rapidly, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. Consequently societal norms have shifted; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate.

In recent years globalization affects local economies, and this suggests an improvement in outcomes. For example societal norms have shifted; therefore, further research is needed. Interestingly students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests greater inequality. On the other hand educational outcomes vary across regions; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate. Generally students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation.
