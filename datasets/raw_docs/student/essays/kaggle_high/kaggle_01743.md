Specifically educational outcomes vary across regions, and this suggests a need for better measurement. Notably societal norms have shifted, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. Consequently students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior. For example societal norms have shifted, which demonstrates an important trade-off. Notably students increasingly rely on digital platforms.

Consequently educational outcomes vary across regions; therefore, further research is needed. Generally educational outcomes vary across regions, and this suggests an improvement in outcomes. Furthermore students increasingly rely on digital platforms. On the other hand societal norms have shifted; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate. Specifically educational outcomes vary across regions, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior.

For example public policy influences innovation. In recent years globalization affects local economies; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate. On the other hand technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate. Consequently students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior. Generally globalization affects local economies, which demonstrates a shift in priorities.
