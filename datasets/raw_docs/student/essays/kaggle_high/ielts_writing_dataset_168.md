The figure shows plans of a museum in 1998 and in 2008, after suffering some changes. The main differences in both plans are the layout of the building and the addition of new facilities.
In 1998, once you entered the museum you would first encounter the entrance/ exit and the thickets shop. On the left, there was a temporary exhibition room and on the right, there was a shop, the bathroom and a bags and coat hanger.
At that time the museum had three permanent exhibition rooms: one on the left, next to the temporary exhibition room, and two on the right, adjacent to the shop and WC.
Separating 2 exhibition rooms, at the top of the plan, there was a cafe. All the spaces mentioned surrounded a central garden.
Similar to 1998, in 2008, people would find a ticket shop in the space designated as an entrance and exit. However, on the left, now is a permanent exhibition room, whereas on the right there's a shop and a bags and coat hanger. The museum still possesses three permanent exhibition rooms, all of them on the right side of the building.
On the left side, adjacent to the shop and hanger there's a temporary exhibition room and next to it a restaurant. At the top of the plan, there's a cafe and a bathroom next to the restaurant and one of the permanent exhibition rooms, respectively.
Just like in 1998, there's a central garden. However, this garden now has new components such as fountains and a cafe sitting area close to the cafe.
In conclusion, the museum in 2008 is much more modern and developed than in 1998. In fact, the building became a facility that welcomes not only people interested in visiting the many exhibitions but also those that just want to have a meal or a cup of coffee in the garden with friends.
