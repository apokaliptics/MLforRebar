For example technology has advanced rapidly. Consequently educational outcomes vary across regions. Specifically students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates a shift in priorities. Generally societal norms have shifted; therefore, stakeholders must respond. Notably globalization affects local economies, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior. Traditionally educational outcomes vary across regions, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation.

In recent years societal norms have shifted, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. Consequently globalization affects local economies; therefore, further research is needed. Generally globalization affects local economies, and this suggests an improvement in outcomes. Furthermore technology has advanced rapidly, and this suggests an improvement in outcomes. Interestingly educational outcomes vary across regions, and this suggests an improvement in outcomes. For example societal norms have shifted; therefore, policy adjustments may help.
