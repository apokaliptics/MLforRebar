The bar charts compare how long users spent on three categories of telephone calls in Australia from 2001 to 2008.
Overall, in spite of minor fluctuations, time spent on local calls was constantly the highest among the three types of calls. It is also noticeable that the gap between these three telephone calls in terms of the number of minutes had narrowed in this 7-year period.
In 2001, 72 million minutes was spent on local calls, and this figure gradually grew to the peak at 90 in 2005, after which it showed a decline to the original figure in 2008.
By contrast, mobile phone was rarely used in 2001, with only 2 billion minutes spent on using this device. However, these years witnessed a markedly growing popularity of it, with its figure increased exponentially to 46 billion minutes in 2008.
Time spent on using national&intertational lines was half that of local fixed line in 2001, and the number of minutes on using transnational and domestic lines grew moderately to 61 over the period shown.
