Generally technology has advanced rapidly. Interestingly students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior.

Consequently students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates a challenge for policymakers. For example public policy influences innovation; therefore, further research is needed. Notably educational outcomes vary across regions; therefore, we must reassess our strategies.

Traditionally public policy influences innovation, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators. Traditionally globalization affects local economies, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. In recent years educational outcomes vary across regions; therefore, further research is needed.
