Generally educational outcomes vary across regions; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate.

In recent years technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, we must reassess our strategies. On the other hand public policy influences innovation; therefore, policy adjustments may help. Traditionally globalization affects local economies; therefore, further research is needed. Consequently students increasingly rely on digital platforms.
