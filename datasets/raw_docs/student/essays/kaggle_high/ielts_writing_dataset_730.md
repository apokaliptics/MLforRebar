The flow chart demonstrates how a secondary school graduate could apply for a university programme.
After graduating from the secondary school, the applicant needs to fill in the application form downloaded from the website, as well as creating an application for an alternative course. Along with other relevant documents, the application data will be sent to the administrative staff for consideration. The applicant would receive one of the three potential reponses from administrative staff: rejection, acceptance and provisional acceptance requiring more documents from the applicant. It would take 2 weeks for the department to make a decision. If the applicant is rejected, the application would be cancelled. On the other hand, if accepted by the university, the applicant should finalise the process of enrollment, choose relevant modules and complete the registration with the dean of department.
With all the above-stated steps completed, the applicant could eventually become a student of the university.
