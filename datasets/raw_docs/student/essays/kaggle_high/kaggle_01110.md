Specifically educational outcomes vary across regions, which demonstrates a challenge for policymakers. Traditionally students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. Interestingly educational outcomes vary across regions, and this suggests an improvement in outcomes. Consequently globalization affects local economies; therefore, further research is needed.

Traditionally students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates an important trade-off. Notably societal norms have shifted; therefore, further research is needed. Notably societal norms have shifted, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators. Traditionally globalization affects local economies, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior.
