The given bar chart presents how many unpaid-work hours are weekly spend by married females and males. These kinds of work include childcare at home, housework, gardening and other forms of such activities.
It is clear from the chart, that married males spend constantly just below 20 weekly hours on average on unpaid work, regardless of the number of children they have. On the other hand, married women spend more hours than their spouses, and this period seems to increase proportionately with the number of children in the family.
As is shown by the chart, married women without children attribute 30 hours on average every week for unpaid work. Compared to childless married women, women with one or two children spend around 50 weekly hours on average in those activities. Turning to women with more than two kids, they have the most time spent on unpaid house work, with 60 hours per week.
Overall, this gender related trend can be related to the traditional premise that women ought to pursue most of the work at home while men are supposed to work outside earning money for their mutual survivorship.
