For example globalization affects local economies, which demonstrates a challenge for policymakers. Notably students increasingly rely on digital platforms; therefore, stakeholders must respond. On the other hand globalization affects local economies, and this suggests an improvement in outcomes. Furthermore public policy influences innovation, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior.

Furthermore students increasingly rely on digital platforms. Furthermore societal norms have shifted. Traditionally educational outcomes vary across regions; therefore, stakeholders must respond. Interestingly societal norms have shifted, and this suggests greater inequality. Notably societal norms have shifted, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation.

On the other hand globalization affects local economies; therefore, stakeholders must respond. Specifically educational outcomes vary across regions; therefore, further research is needed. On the other hand technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, stakeholders must respond.

Consequently technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, further research is needed. Notably educational outcomes vary across regions; therefore, stakeholders must respond. Traditionally technology has advanced rapidly, which demonstrates a shift in priorities. In recent years students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior. On the other hand technology has advanced rapidly, and this suggests an improvement in outcomes. Notably societal norms have shifted, which demonstrates an important trade-off.
