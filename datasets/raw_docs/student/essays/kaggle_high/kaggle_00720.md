Traditionally societal norms have shifted, which demonstrates a shift in priorities. In recent years students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates an important trade-off. Interestingly educational outcomes vary across regions, and this suggests a need for better measurement. Consequently globalization affects local economies, and this suggests a reconsideration of values.
