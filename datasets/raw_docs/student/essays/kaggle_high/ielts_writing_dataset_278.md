The bar chart illustrates the man-hours in the pedagogical work in 2001 across Japan, USA, Iceland, and Spain. The results of the survey were taken from primary, lower secondary, and upper secondary schools.
The primary schools are the easiest to work on with each country, Japanese teachers spend exactly 600 hours, while in Iceland the overall time is marginally less. Spain and USA are at the level of dedication with about 620 hours.
The lower secondary schools pay more attention to education. However, the increase in hours is slight in Japan and Iceland by about 10 to 20 hours. Spaniards take this type of school a bit more seriously, whereas Americans put extra effort to tutor for more than 900 hours.
The upper secondary education is universally the most intense. Japanese rise their hours by small margin as usual, while Spanish and Icelandic people almost reach 920 hour mark. In United States, the effort is taken to a whole new level with teacher working whopping 1100 hours.
