The diagram illustrates how carbonated drinks are made from raw water using different equipments at different stages.
Overall, there are 5 stages involved in the process from using water from houses to packaging the drinks using either bottles or cans for safe consumption. They water is basically transported using pipes.
The first stage involves cleaning the raw water from residential homes using a filter and then adding a water softener and other chemicals to it. The water is then pumped for heating evaporation and carbonation where it is heated using electric heaters, cooled through a cooling pipe and then carbonated in a tank using carbon dioxide.
This carbonated water is then transferred into the mixing tank where it is mixed and colouring,syrup and flavour is added to it at this point. The end product is finally filtered and filled into bottles or cans which is then packaged into boxes and transported for sale in the supermarket.
