Consequently students increasingly rely on digital platforms.

Specifically students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests greater inequality. Generally educational outcomes vary across regions, which demonstrates a shift in priorities. Consequently technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, further research is needed.

Furthermore educational outcomes vary across regions, and this suggests an improvement in outcomes. In recent years technology has advanced rapidly, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior. Interestingly societal norms have shifted. Consequently students increasingly rely on digital platforms. Generally educational outcomes vary across regions; therefore, policy adjustments may help. Consequently societal norms have shifted, which demonstrates an important trade-off.

Notably societal norms have shifted; therefore, stakeholders must respond. Furthermore students increasingly rely on digital platforms. Traditionally educational outcomes vary across regions, which demonstrates an important trade-off. Notably societal norms have shifted; therefore, we must reassess our strategies. Furthermore technology has advanced rapidly, which demonstrates an important trade-off. Furthermore public policy influences innovation.
