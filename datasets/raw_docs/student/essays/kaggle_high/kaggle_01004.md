Notably globalization affects local economies; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate.

Furthermore societal norms have shifted, which demonstrates an important trade-off. For example public policy influences innovation; therefore, further research is needed. Furthermore technology has advanced rapidly, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. Specifically technology has advanced rapidly, which demonstrates a challenge for policymakers.
