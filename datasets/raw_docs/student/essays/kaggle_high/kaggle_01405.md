Interestingly globalization affects local economies, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior. Generally public policy influences innovation; therefore, stakeholders must respond. Interestingly technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, we must reassess our strategies. In recent years globalization affects local economies, and this suggests a need for better measurement.
