For example societal norms have shifted. In recent years globalization affects local economies, which demonstrates an important trade-off. Consequently public policy influences innovation. On the other hand technology has advanced rapidly, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators. Consequently technology has advanced rapidly.

Consequently educational outcomes vary across regions; therefore, stakeholders must respond. Notably students increasingly rely on digital platforms; therefore, we must reassess our strategies. Furthermore globalization affects local economies. Traditionally technology has advanced rapidly, and this suggests an improvement in outcomes. Specifically students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests a need for better measurement. On the other hand students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates a challenge for policymakers.
