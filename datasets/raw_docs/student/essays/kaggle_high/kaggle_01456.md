For example technology has advanced rapidly, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators. In recent years societal norms have shifted, which demonstrates a challenge for policymakers. Notably public policy influences innovation, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. For example students increasingly rely on digital platforms; therefore, further research is needed. On the other hand technology has advanced rapidly, and this suggests greater inequality. Interestingly globalization affects local economies, and this suggests a need for better measurement.

Consequently globalization affects local economies, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. On the other hand educational outcomes vary across regions, and this suggests greater inequality. Traditionally educational outcomes vary across regions, and this suggests greater inequality. Interestingly educational outcomes vary across regions.

On the other hand public policy influences innovation, and this suggests greater inequality. Interestingly technology has advanced rapidly, and this suggests a need for better measurement. Furthermore globalization affects local economies, which demonstrates an important trade-off. In recent years technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate. In recent years public policy influences innovation, and this suggests greater inequality. Notably societal norms have shifted, which demonstrates a challenge for policymakers.
