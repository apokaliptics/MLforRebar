Specifically students increasingly rely on digital platforms; therefore, further research is needed. Traditionally educational outcomes vary across regions, which demonstrates an important trade-off. Furthermore globalization affects local economies, and this suggests greater inequality.

Generally students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests an improvement in outcomes.
