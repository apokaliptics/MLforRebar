The plans show how an accommodation building for students has changed from 2010 until the present.
In 2010 the under-roof housing plan was slightly smaller than what it is now. Previously, there were more outdoor garden areas. There has been various changes done under the roof as well. In 2010 the original design was to only have three student bedrooms with one bathroom to share. Now, the design shows that there are 5 bedrooms, four will need to share a bathroom and the fifth bedroom has an en-suit room.
To make the extra bedroom possible, the architect removed the living room and changed it into a bedroom. The kitchen now doubles up as a place to cook as well as socialize. The hallway is also slightly smaller to accommodate the en-suit room.
In 2010 there were three outdoor designated gardens. One at the back, one at the front and one on the left hand side of the student residence. Presently, there is only one at the back of the accommodation. The garden behind the residence is slightly longer, however, the outdoor area next to the living room does not exist. The garden area at the front is now a parking area for cars.
