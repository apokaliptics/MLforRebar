Consequently students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests a need for better measurement.

Specifically educational outcomes vary across regions; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate. Furthermore technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, we must reassess our strategies. For example students increasingly rely on digital platforms.

Consequently globalization affects local economies; therefore, we must reassess our strategies. Notably educational outcomes vary across regions, and this suggests greater inequality. Specifically students increasingly rely on digital platforms. Generally globalization affects local economies. Furthermore students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates an important trade-off.
