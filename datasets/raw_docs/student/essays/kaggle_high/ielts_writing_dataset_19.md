In recent years, many countries have reported a decrease in the number of students choosing science subjects in universities. This is a concerning trend that can have a profound impact on society. In this essay, I will discuss the reasons behind this problem and its implications.
The first reason for fewer students selecting science subjects is likely that these courses are difficult to comprehend. In general, science courses such as mathematics and physics involve complex theories, formulas, and concepts that require a great deal of hard work to understand. Furthermore, they are often taught in a theoretical manner and fail to show students how this knowledge can be used in real life. In other words, it may seem impractical for them to learn science courses. Lastly, it may be hard to acquire a practical job through these theoretical subjects in the future. As a result, students may give up studying science because they find scientific studies unappealing, impractical, and not promising for their future careers.
Consequently, the lack of students studying science subjects can have a significant impact on society. First and foremost, there may not be enough qualified scientists and teachers to teach the theoretical foundation of technology, medicine, and engineering. This could lead to slow progress in these areas, and society may suffer as a result. Moreover, the decline in the number of science students could lead to a shortage of scientists for research and development in industry, which would have a negative impact on the nation's economy.
To sum up, the decreasing number of students selecting science courses in universities is a worrying phenomenon. The main reasons for this are the difficulty of science courses and the lack of job opportunities in science after studies. This could have a negative impact on society, as there may not be enough qualified scientists to pursue research, and this could impede progress in fields such as technology and medicine.
