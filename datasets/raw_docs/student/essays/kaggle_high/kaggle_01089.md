Generally technology has advanced rapidly, which demonstrates a challenge for policymakers. Traditionally educational outcomes vary across regions, and this suggests a need for better measurement. Consequently educational outcomes vary across regions. In recent years globalization affects local economies, which demonstrates a challenge for policymakers.

Consequently educational outcomes vary across regions, which demonstrates a challenge for policymakers. For example globalization affects local economies, and this suggests greater inequality. Notably students increasingly rely on digital platforms; therefore, further research is needed.
