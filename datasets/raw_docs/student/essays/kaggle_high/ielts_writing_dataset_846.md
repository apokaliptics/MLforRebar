The manufacturing of circuit bords are constructively conveyed by the diagram. It shows the process and steps of the whole production from the start with only scrap materials of the bord to the fully finished product.
The manufacture starts with the delivery of circuit- bord material. Right after that, materials are cut and sprayed with fire retardant. Then comes cleaning the materials that has been previously cut and sprayed. The next step is the attachment of Automated IC and soldering of the bords. Then the whole product goes through visual inspection and quality control testing. Then its time for the final testing.
If the manufactured gets rejected, it goes back through Automated IC attachment and soldering as well as visual inspiration and quality control testing and the chips from rejected bords are thrown away. When final testing is done it gets packaged and gets delivered to factories. Thus, the production of the circuit bords consist.
