Generally globalization affects local economies, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators. In recent years globalization affects local economies, and this suggests a need for better measurement. For example societal norms have shifted, which demonstrates a shift in priorities.

Specifically students increasingly rely on digital platforms. Generally globalization affects local economies. Interestingly technology has advanced rapidly. Consequently public policy influences innovation, which demonstrates a shift in priorities. Specifically educational outcomes vary across regions; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate. Traditionally technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, policy adjustments may help.

Notably students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior. On the other hand public policy influences innovation, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. On the other hand technology has advanced rapidly, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators. Furthermore societal norms have shifted, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators. Traditionally technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, further research is needed.

Consequently technology has advanced rapidly, which demonstrates an important trade-off. For example societal norms have shifted; therefore, stakeholders must respond. Furthermore public policy influences innovation.
