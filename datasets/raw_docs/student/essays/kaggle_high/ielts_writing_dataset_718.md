The given flow chart demostrates the effects of deforestation on nature. These influences can occur through four possible routes.
First, one of the initial impacts of such activity is when heavy logging instruments compress the soil, making it hard and baked. Thus, rain water may run off and eventually resulting in flooding. Secondly, with clear cutting of forests, there is a decrease in roots that hold the top soil in it. This will lead to soil erosion.
Moreover, deforestaion is belived to rise the likelihood of burning, either delibrately or accidentally. As waste food from logging is destroyed, some micro-organisms that feed on it might vanish. Other species get in the field, causing a degradation of vegetation. This could be also a result of soil erosion or an increase of drought. All of these events are responsible for less biodiversity. Finally, a decrease in plants means less moisture to air, less precipitation and more exacerbation of drought.
Overall, as is shown by this chart, the deforestation process has substantial repersussions on nature through various ways. Unless any decrease of this detrimental activity, nature would witness flooding, soil erosions, less biodiversity and severe drought.
