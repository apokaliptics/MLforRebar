The pie graphs illustrate the amount of time spent by a working class on six different activities (working, relaxing at home, sleeping, travelling to work, going out, and other hobbies) in a country in 1958 and 2008.
Overall, the percentage of time spent on all the activities had increased in 50 years but going out with friends and sleeping. We can see that people spent more time relaxing at home and on other interests in 2008 compared to 1958.
In 1958, people spent one-third of the time working, which increased in 2008 by 9% and it remained the top priority among working adults. However, people spent the least time on travelling to work in 1958, which was 2% though by 2008 people started spending 8% of their time commuting to work.
It is evident from both the graphs that people spent almost one-fifth of the time with their family and friends in 1958 which was the third most time-consuming activity. On the contrary, in 2008, this activity became the least preferred activity with only 6% of the time. People also deprived of their sleep in 2008 as it decreased from 32% to 25%.
