The given diagram illustrates how a storage area can be created using concrete canvas.
Overall, the process involves in eight different steps which are manufacturing, delivering, unwrapping, spreading the material on the ground, the use of an air pump followed by the action of watering, setting and storing.
Firstly, the process of creating a storage area starts by manufacturing the concrete canvas which consists of three different layers: the top layer is called the fibrous top surface followed by a layer of dry concrete and a waterproof layer. Next, the material is delivered and unwrapped to be spread out on the ground surface. The spreading process involves in covering an area of 10 metres using pegs and a rope.
Then, under the covered area, some air is pumped through an air pump facing the door. This step is followed by a watering action that reaches 8 metres in height. Finally, the area is left setting for about 20-24 hours until the storage area is created.
