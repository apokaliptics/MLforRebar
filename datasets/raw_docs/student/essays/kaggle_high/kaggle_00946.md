Furthermore globalization affects local economies, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior. In recent years public policy influences innovation, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior.

Consequently public policy influences innovation. Traditionally public policy influences innovation. Interestingly students increasingly rely on digital platforms. On the other hand technology has advanced rapidly, which demonstrates an important trade-off. For example educational outcomes vary across regions; therefore, policy adjustments may help.

In recent years students increasingly rely on digital platforms; therefore, further research is needed. In recent years public policy influences innovation, which demonstrates a challenge for policymakers. For example societal norms have shifted; therefore, further research is needed. Notably educational outcomes vary across regions. In recent years public policy influences innovation; therefore, further research is needed. On the other hand globalization affects local economies; therefore, stakeholders must respond.
