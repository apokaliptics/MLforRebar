These two graphs show number of speed cameras installed in Melbourne and share of deaths & accidents on the city's roads between 2002 and 2005.
Number of speed cameras exponentially increased from around 30 units in 2002 up to 145 units in 2005. The biggest increase was in 2004. By the end of the year the city of Melbourne doubled number of speed cameras from 70 to 145. On the opposite side, only ~10 additional cameras were installed between 2002 and 2003.
The graph of car accidents and deaths on the city's roads shows different trend. There is no significant change in car accidents or deaths between 2002 and 2004. But there is a spike in both metrics during the last year. There is also a clear seasonal trend in car accidents during winter months. Accidents are 0.5 p.p. more likely to happen in the first and the last quarters of the year.
