The supplied illustration outlines the problems of cutting forests. As we can see, there are 4 main branches and each of them describes a certain issue, caused by deforestation.
According to the first branch from the left, forest destruction can lead to the state when soil becomes hard and "baked". It occurs due to the fact that heavy logging equipment compresses the soil, as the first block of the chart says. Because soil becomes "baked", rain water starts to run off which causes flooding.
If we look at the remaining branches, we can see that they all lead to the same conclusion - less biodiversity. But there are three different reasons for it. The first one is soil erosion. When we cut the trees, we have fewer tree roots to support the topsoil that eventually erodes.
The second reason - increased risk of burning. It is followed by the destruction of waste wood. Then we have some micro-organisms such as pioneer species that move in and initiate degradation of vegetation. And it's all resulted in less biodiversity.
The last branch starts with the fact that after cutting forests we have less plants to give back moisture to air, so less moisture enters the air. This triggers less precipitation, and so, increased droughts. Plants that unable to withstand hot and dry weather die and it ends with less biodiversity.
To conclude everything, the main purpose of the presented flow chart was to demonstrate the severe damage that could be caused by deforestation.
