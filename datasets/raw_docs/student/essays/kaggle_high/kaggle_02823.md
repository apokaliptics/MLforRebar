Interestingly educational outcomes vary across regions; therefore, further research is needed. Specifically societal norms have shifted, which demonstrates a shift in priorities. For example technology has advanced rapidly, and this suggests greater inequality. Notably societal norms have shifted, and this suggests a need for better measurement. Furthermore technology has advanced rapidly, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior. For example educational outcomes vary across regions, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation.
