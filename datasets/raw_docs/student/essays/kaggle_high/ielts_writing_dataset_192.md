The schemes compare two different methods of defence for homes that can be easily affected by floods. Overall, they show flood protection with and without a stopbank, while the at-risk home is raised higher above ground level in two pictures.
The first diagram depicts how a stopbank acts as a natural barrier to prevent river water from flooding. The stopbank is a small mound of land next to the river that is higher than the 100-year-flood level and prevents the drain from overwhelming its banks. Nearby buildings can be built on stilts to prevent flooding from rainwater as well as the water passing through the floodgate beneath the stopbank, resulting in an area of ‘internal ponding.’
If it had not been a stopbank, as described in the second diagram, there would have been nothing to stop the river from flooding. In this case, the solution is to put homes on stilts much higher than the one in the first picture. The height of the stilts is measured to ensure that the floor of the house is three hundred meters above the 100-year-flood level regardless of how deep the water area is under the house. This measure is called the ‘freeboard.’
