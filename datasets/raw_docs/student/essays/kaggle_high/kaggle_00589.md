Specifically technology has advanced rapidly, and this suggests greater inequality. Generally students increasingly rely on digital platforms; therefore, policy adjustments may help. Consequently globalization affects local economies.

Traditionally technology has advanced rapidly. In recent years educational outcomes vary across regions, and this suggests an improvement in outcomes. For example technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate. On the other hand educational outcomes vary across regions; therefore, further research is needed. Specifically societal norms have shifted; therefore, policy adjustments may help. Interestingly societal norms have shifted, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation.
