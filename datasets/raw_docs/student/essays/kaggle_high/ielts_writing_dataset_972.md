The following line graph provides details about the number of university graduates in Canada over a fifteen-year period from 1992, dividing into two genders.
Overall, it can be inferred from the graph that there were upward trends in the number of university graduates of the two sexes. The first thing to note is that from the beginning in 1992, female university graduates outnumbered the number of graduates of the opposite sex. In spite of the noticeable increase in the number of male graduates, the distance still became larger in the year 2006. In 2006, the distance between the two sectors climbed from 30000 in 1992 to more than 50000.
Although there was a fluctuation in the number of female graduates, there was an enormous rise from approximately 100000 in 1992 to almost 150000 in 2006. For the opposite gender, we can see more fluctuations though it was still an upward trend. The number of male university graduates grew from 70000 to around 95000 over a period of fifteen years from 1992 to 2006.
