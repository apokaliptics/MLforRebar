The chart illustrates numbers of incidents and injuries per 100 million passenger miles travelled in 2002. It is divided into five transportation type: by commuter rail, by heavy rail, by light rail, by bus and by demand response.
Overall, we notice the highest number of incident and injuries is due to transportation by demand response, while the use of commuter rail has the lowest number of these accidents. The number of injuries is lower than incident in all cases.
In the case of commuter rail, the number of incidents which represents less than 30 incidents per 100 million PMT is almost equal to the number of injuries. The graph shows some similarities when we use light rail or bus, especially in regards of incidents. The numbers of incidents in both cases are about 75 incidents per 100 million PMT. However, the number of injuries increases from approximately 40 to 60 injuries per 100 million PMT. The transportation by demand response is responsible of more than 250 incidents and 150 injuries per 100 million PMT.
