Information regarding the millions of overseas journeys from five different regions every five years from 1990 to 2005 is provided in the table.
Overall, it can be seen that the total number of international trips grew substantially over the 15-year period. Of those millions of travels, Europe represented the highest and the Middle East represented the lowest.
One of the most notorious characteristics of the table was the increase in the total of travels from 448.9 million in 1990 to 693.7 million in 2005. European travelled the most during the 15-years period, accounting for 400.2 million in 2005, accounting for around third-fifths of the total. Those in the Middle East went to overseas more too, but they remained with the lowest numbers from 9.8 in 1990 to 15.8 million in 2005.
