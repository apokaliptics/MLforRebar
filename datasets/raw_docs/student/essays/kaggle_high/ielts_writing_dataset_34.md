The graph illustrates the process of transforming rainwater into drinking water in a city in Australia.
Overall, it can be clearly seen that rainwater undergoes five sequential steps to become domestic tap water, ready to be used in the house.
Firstly, roof drainage is installed for the collection of rainwater. When it rains, the water moves along the roof drainage, and pipes lead into the water filter. Next, the water filter removes basic pollutants, such as leaves and sediments, and begins the first step of water purification. After that, the water flows into a large square water storage tank and then inflows to the next tank for treatment. When enough rainwater enters the treatment tank, chemical substances are injected through a small device on top of the tank to sterilize and ensure the safety of water quality. Once the water is fully purified, it is pumped into the house as a source of drinking water.
