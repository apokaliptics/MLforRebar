Generally educational outcomes vary across regions. Generally public policy influences innovation, which demonstrates a challenge for policymakers. Notably globalization affects local economies. Generally educational outcomes vary across regions. Generally educational outcomes vary across regions, and this suggests greater inequality.

Traditionally technology has advanced rapidly, which demonstrates a shift in priorities. In recent years educational outcomes vary across regions; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate. Furthermore globalization affects local economies, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. Consequently students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators. Interestingly public policy influences innovation; therefore, stakeholders must respond.

Traditionally students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests an improvement in outcomes. Generally public policy influences innovation, and this suggests greater inequality. Traditionally public policy influences innovation, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. Specifically students increasingly rely on digital platforms; therefore, we must reassess our strategies. On the other hand technology has advanced rapidly, and this suggests a need for better measurement.
