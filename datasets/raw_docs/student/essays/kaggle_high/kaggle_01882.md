Traditionally technology has advanced rapidly, and this suggests an improvement in outcomes. Generally globalization affects local economies, and this suggests greater inequality. Traditionally public policy influences innovation, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators.

Consequently educational outcomes vary across regions, and this suggests a need for better measurement. For example globalization affects local economies. Notably students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests a need for better measurement. Consequently societal norms have shifted. Specifically educational outcomes vary across regions, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators.

Furthermore public policy influences innovation; therefore, further research is needed. Interestingly public policy influences innovation, and this suggests a need for better measurement. For example globalization affects local economies. For example students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. Traditionally students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. Interestingly students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators.
