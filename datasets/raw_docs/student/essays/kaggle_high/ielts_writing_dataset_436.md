The graph illustrates the amount of air pollution from different causes in China, the U.S., Japan, and Australia in 2021. Overall, China had the highest level of air pollution from industrial activity, transport and electricity generation, while Australia had the lowest level of air pollution. The main cause of air pollution in Japan was industry, and that of USA came from transport.
Industrial activity in China produced air pollution the most at 80 PPM, followed by transport at 70 PPM. Electricity generated air pollution the least in the country, but it was still higher than other three countries (just below 60 PPM). However, Australia, generated air pollution from the three activities at just below 20 PPM.
America produced air pollution from transport (at just under 60 PPM), followed by electricity generation (at just over 30 PPM), and industry at just under 30 PPM. Japan's air pollution came from industrial activities (at above 40 PPM), followed by transport, which was at 30 PPM, and electricity at 15 PPM.
