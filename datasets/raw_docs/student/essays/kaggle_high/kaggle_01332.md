Interestingly educational outcomes vary across regions, which demonstrates an important trade-off. In recent years educational outcomes vary across regions, which demonstrates a challenge for policymakers. For example technology has advanced rapidly.

For example technology has advanced rapidly, and this suggests a need for better measurement.

On the other hand technology has advanced rapidly, which demonstrates an important trade-off. Traditionally public policy influences innovation, and this suggests a reconsideration of values. Consequently societal norms have shifted, and this suggests greater inequality. Furthermore globalization affects local economies. Interestingly educational outcomes vary across regions.
