Generally students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates an important trade-off.

Notably globalization affects local economies, and this suggests an improvement in outcomes. Furthermore societal norms have shifted; therefore, stakeholders must respond. Notably public policy influences innovation, and this suggests greater inequality. Interestingly globalization affects local economies. Notably societal norms have shifted, and this suggests an improvement in outcomes. In recent years educational outcomes vary across regions; therefore, further research is needed.

Furthermore educational outcomes vary across regions. Traditionally globalization affects local economies. Traditionally technology has advanced rapidly, which demonstrates a shift in priorities. In recent years technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate.
