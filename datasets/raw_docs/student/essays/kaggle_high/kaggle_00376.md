Traditionally societal norms have shifted, which demonstrates a shift in priorities. Specifically educational outcomes vary across regions, which demonstrates an important trade-off. Specifically educational outcomes vary across regions, and this suggests a need for better measurement. On the other hand educational outcomes vary across regions; therefore, we must reassess our strategies.
