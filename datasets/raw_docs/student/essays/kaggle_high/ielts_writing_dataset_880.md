From the map we can see three possible locations for a leisure centre. Each prospective location has different surroundings: the (A) mark is situated near some factory or energy plant with a dense smoke all around, the (B) mark is near apartement buildings and the (C) mark is surrounded by hill and forest.
It is also clear from the map that different proposed locations have different transport accessibility: there is a road connecting the (A) and (B) marks along with the apartements, while the (C) mark is not accessible with vehicles.
Another notable feature is the river crossing the middle of the map. While the (A) and (B) locations are close enough to the river, the (C) is quite far from it, having no direct access to water.
Finally, the forest separates the (C) mark from all the infrastructure and pollution of the living block and the factory, introducing some pros and cons, which should be considered.
