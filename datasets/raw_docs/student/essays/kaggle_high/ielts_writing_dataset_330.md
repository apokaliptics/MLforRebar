The diagram contains information about the manufacturing of carbonated drinks. In general, the process has five main stages, which start with water cleaning and end with packing.
In the first stage, water is cleaned, in order to do this step water is filtered, softened, and processed with chemicals. Then water is pumped to electrical heaters, which prepare it to enter the second stage. In the second stage water is cooled through a special pipe and processed with carbon dioxide. In the following stage carbonated water is mixed with colors, syrups, and flavors, in order to complete this stage mixing tank is needed. In the fourth stage water can be filtered and filled into bottles and cans. Finally, carbonated drinks are packed and delivered to supermarkets.
