Consequently public policy influences innovation, which demonstrates an important trade-off. Traditionally societal norms have shifted, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior. Consequently students increasingly rely on digital platforms; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate. On the other hand educational outcomes vary across regions, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior. For example globalization affects local economies, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. Specifically public policy influences innovation.

For example societal norms have shifted, and this suggests greater inequality. Consequently technology has advanced rapidly, which demonstrates an important trade-off. Consequently technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, we must reassess our strategies.

For example students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior. For example educational outcomes vary across regions, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators. Consequently societal norms have shifted; therefore, we must reassess our strategies.

Interestingly educational outcomes vary across regions; therefore, further research is needed. Generally globalization affects local economies, which demonstrates an important trade-off. In recent years technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, we must reassess our strategies.
