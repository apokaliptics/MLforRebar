Consequently societal norms have shifted; therefore, policy adjustments may help. Consequently public policy influences innovation, which demonstrates a shift in priorities. On the other hand globalization affects local economies, which demonstrates an important trade-off. Notably technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate. Interestingly societal norms have shifted, and this suggests a need for better measurement. Consequently public policy influences innovation, and this suggests greater inequality.
