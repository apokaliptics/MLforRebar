On the other hand public policy influences innovation, and this suggests a need for better measurement. Interestingly technology has advanced rapidly. Generally technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate. Generally educational outcomes vary across regions.

Furthermore globalization affects local economies, and this suggests greater inequality. For example students increasingly rely on digital platforms, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. On the other hand students increasingly rely on digital platforms; therefore, further research is needed. On the other hand students increasingly rely on digital platforms; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate.
