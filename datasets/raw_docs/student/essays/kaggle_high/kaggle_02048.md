For example societal norms have shifted. On the other hand societal norms have shifted, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators.

Generally public policy influences innovation. Furthermore societal norms have shifted; therefore, further research is needed. Specifically students increasingly rely on digital platforms; therefore, stakeholders should collaborate. In recent years public policy influences innovation, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. Consequently public policy influences innovation, and this suggests greater inequality.
