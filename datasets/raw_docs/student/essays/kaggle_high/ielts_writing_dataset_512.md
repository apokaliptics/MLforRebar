The pictures give information about two ways of protecting houses from flooding. Overall, the houses or buildings are constructed on stamps.
The first way of protecting buildings from floods it to make them far away from the water and not to close to the hill or mountain to avoid any water coming down. Additionally, the stopbank should be place close to the water as a protection wall. At the bottom of the stopbank a floodgate is allocated so that water can pass to the internal pond underneath the house without touching it and a bem is situated to the water side which can open and close depending on the water level.
The second diagram does not have a stopbank and the house is positioned closer to the water. The house is built on higher stamps, so that the water can flow underneath it. Between house and water, a freeboard of around 300mm can be found where no water should be, so that the house remains dry.
