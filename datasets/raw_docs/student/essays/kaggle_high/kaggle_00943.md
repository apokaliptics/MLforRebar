On the other hand societal norms have shifted, which demonstrates a challenge for policymakers. For example societal norms have shifted, and this suggests greater inequality. Furthermore students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests greater inequality. Furthermore technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, further research is needed.

In recent years educational outcomes vary across regions, which demonstrates an important trade-off. On the other hand students increasingly rely on digital platforms; therefore, further research is needed. Notably technology has advanced rapidly; therefore, policy adjustments may help.

For example educational outcomes vary across regions, which demonstrates a growing need for regulation. Notably globalization affects local economies. For example technology has advanced rapidly. On the other hand globalization affects local economies, which demonstrates a challenge for policymakers.
