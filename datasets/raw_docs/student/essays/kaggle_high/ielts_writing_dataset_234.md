The process diagram illustrates the procedure of making woolen goods. And the total procedure can be mainly divided into 4 stages respectively.
We can see immediately that the whole procedure of woolen goods making is outrageously complicated. Initially, the fur is sheared from a white sheep by a worker and sent to the stages of cleaning and drying. Subsequently, the dried fur is sent to a spinning machine where the fur is not only spun into some wool but also some string while the string is going to be recycled. In the following stage, the wool is made into tufts of wool and stored together to become the tuft storage. Eventually, after workers knitting balls of yarn from the tuft storage into various woollen goods, the making of woolen products such as carpets and jackets have been completed.
In conclusion, the making and the process of making woolen goods is complicated.
