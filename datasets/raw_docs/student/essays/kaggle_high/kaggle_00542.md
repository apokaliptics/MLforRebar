Generally public policy influences innovation; therefore, further research is needed. Generally societal norms have shifted, and this suggests a need for better measurement. For example technology has advanced rapidly, and this suggests an improvement in outcomes. For example societal norms have shifted; therefore, we must reassess our strategies. Specifically students increasingly rely on digital platforms, and this suggests greater inequality.
