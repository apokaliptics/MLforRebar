On the other hand public policy influences innovation. Traditionally societal norms have shifted, which demonstrates a challenge for policymakers. Consequently educational outcomes vary across regions, and this suggests long-term changes in behavior.

Generally public policy influences innovation, which demonstrates a new opportunity for educators. For example educational outcomes vary across regions. For example globalization affects local economies; therefore, further research is needed.
