The bar chart illustrates the number of minutes of telephone calls in Australia, made to various localities or devices, from 2001 to 2008.
Over the course of the eight years during which the data was sampled, it can be noted that the number of phone call minutes made to mobile phones has increased by the greatest proportion. In 2001, 2 billion minutes worth of phone call time was recorded. By 2008, this number had increased exponentially to 46 billion minutes.
The bar chart illustrates that between the years 2001 and 2005, the number of phone calls made to local numbers gradually increased. However, from 2006, these calls decreased steadily until 2008, with a number that is only slightly higher than national and international calling minutes.
The number of phone call minutes made to national as well as international locations consistently increased in the allocated time frame.
It is also clear that local telephone calls account for the majority of phone calls made in Australia, and telephone calls made to mobile phones account for the least.
In summary, the number of telephone call minutes made in Australia in different categories, varied during the years 2001 to 2008.
