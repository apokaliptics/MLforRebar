The given diagrams provide an illustration of a modern landfill for household wastes. Overall, a typical landfill is a man-made hole dug on a solid, two-layer base in which household refuse is kept and toxic liquids are removed from the landfill by the use of a system of pipes.
The construction of a landfill commences when a large hole is dug out of a site with natural rock underneath. The bottom of the hole is thereafter covered with a layer of clay and another layer of unspecified synthetic substance. A drainage tank which is a box-shaped compartment dug through the two aforementioned layers and a set of drainage pipes are also installed.
When used, the landfill is filled up with household waste, with the leachate being extracted and eventually flowing out of the site in liners. Once the rubbish has been converted into a mud-like compound, the landfill is sealed with clay, and gases that are emitted as a result of the conversion is eventually pumped out to an unspecified zone
