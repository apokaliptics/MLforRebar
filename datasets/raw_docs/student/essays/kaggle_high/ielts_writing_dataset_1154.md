The following diagram elaborates the steps of coffee processing and production. The diagram contains different graphs that each gives an idea of each step in order.
Overall, coffee processing takes eleven steps until it is readily available for us to consume.
First of all, farmers pick the beans off the trees as they ripen and then expose them to the sun in the open air to dry. Afterwards, the dried beans are put in a big closed pot in which the beans are roasted by heat.
Then, and rapidly, the heated beans are cooled off. In the fifth step, the beans are put in a grinder where they are crushed into tiny pieces. The crushed beans then are mixed with hot water and the mixture is strained.
Additionally, the mixture is then cooled till they are frozen. In this step the product is just a frozen liquid that is grinded again.
Moreover, the mixture is then put in a vacuumed pot in which it is heated to evaporate the water rendering the product completely dry and ready to be packed.
Lastly, the mixture is packed into jars that we know of ready to be used and consumed.
