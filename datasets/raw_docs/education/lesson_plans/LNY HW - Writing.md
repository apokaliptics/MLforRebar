**HOMEWORK LUNAR NEW YEAR**

TASK 1:

1. The pie chart below shows the main reasons why agricultural land becomes less productive. The table shows how these causes affected three regions of the world during the 1990s.

*(image removed)*

The given pie chart illustrates the main reasons for the productivity recession of agricultural land, while the table demonstrates how these factors affected North America, Europe, Oceania during the 1990s

As can be seen from two graphs, over-grazing is the largest global cause of land degradation , followed by deforestation and over-cultivation. Moreover, Europe experienced the highest total land degradation.

Regarding the pie chart, over-grazing is the dominant factor contributing to land degradation worldwide, accounting for 35% of the total factors. Deforestation and over-cultivation are not far behind, each contributing nearly one-third of the overall degradation. The remaining 7% is caused by other unspecified factors, which played a relatively minor role compared to the three main contributors.

Regionally, Europe has the largest proportion of degraded land, primarily due to deforestation with nearly one in ten. Meanwhile, over-cultivation and over-grazing closely followed behind, with 2.2% gap and 4.4% gap respectively. In North America, over-cultivation is the main factor of the land recession with 3.3%, and this region has the lowest overall slowdown at 5%. In Oceania, over-grazing dominated as the leading cause, responsible for an overwhelming 11.3% of degraded land. Deforestation also contributed, though to a much lesser extent around 2%. The total degraded land in Oceania amounted to 13%.

1. The chart below gives information about how families in one country spent their weekly income in 1968 and 2018. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

*(image removed)*

The given bar chart compares the proportion of weekly income spent on different categories by families in one country in 1968 and 2018.

Overall, in 1968, families spent the majority of their income on food, while in 2018, housing and leisure became the dominant categories. Nonetheless, spending on household goods remained stable.

In 1968, food was the largest expenditure, accounting for 35% of weekly income. However, by 2018, this figure drops sharply to nearly 15%. Similarly, spending on fuel and power fell slightly by 2%, while clothing and footwear decreases by 5%.

Similarly, spending on fuel and power fell slightly by one-third of the 5% data recorded in 1968.

In contrast, spending on housing almost doubled, rising from 10% in 1968 to around a fifth in 2018. Leisure saw the most dramatic growth, becoming the highest category at over a fifth, up from just under one in ten. Transport expenditure also rose significantly, up from just under 10% to approximately 15%.

TASK 2

1. Some people believe young people should have the freedom to make mistakes while others argue that adults should prevent them from doing so. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

In this day and age, some people hold the belief that it is necessary for the young to be free to make mistakes, while others argue that adults should prohibit them from doing so. In this essay, I will address both viewpoints and discuss my own opinion.

On one hand, allowing young people to make mistakes is crucial for their personal growth. Mistakes provide valuable lessons, helping young individuals develop problem-solving skills and become more independent. For instance, a student who fails an exam due to poor time management learns the importance of preparation and discipline. Moreover, experiencing failure fosters resilience, as it teaches them how to cope with setbacks. Additionally, having the freedom to explore and experiment encourages creativity, which is vital for innovation.

On the other hand, adults play an essential role in guiding the younger generation and preventing major errors. Adults have more life experience and can foresee potential dangers that young people might overlook. For example, advising against excessive spending can save a young person from falling into debt. Furthermore, protecting young people from severe mistakes reduces emotional and physical harm, enabling them to focus on personal development without unnecessary setbacks.

Admittedly, constant interference might hinder their ability to learn self-reliance and make independent decisions. Accordingly, in my opinion, a balanced approach is ideal. Young people should be given the freedom to make minor mistakes and learn from them, while adults should prevent errors that could have serious consequences. This ensures a balance between personal growth and safety.

In conclusion, both perspectives have merit, and combining them creates the most supportive environment for young people’s development.

1. In many countries, people are now living longer than ever before. Some people say an aging population creates problems for governments. Other people think there are benefits if society has more elderly people. To what extent do the advantages of having an aging population outweigh the disadvantages?

In many parts of the world, as people live longer, the aging population has become a prominent issue. While some argue that this creates significant challenges for governments, others highlight the benefits elderly people bring to society. This essay will explore both views and conclude that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.

One notable benefit of an aging population is the wealth of experience and knowledge elderly individuals contribute. Many serve as mentors or advisors, providing guidance to younger generations in their personal and professional lives. Additionally, they often play crucial roles in family dynamics, helping to raise grandchildren and fostering intergenerational bonds. Economically, an aging population leads to increased demand in sectors like healthcare, tourism, and elderly care, creating job opportunities and stimulating growth. Take AARP (American Association of Retired Persons) as the paragon, it is an [organization](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/vi/dictionary/english/organization) in the US that [provides](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/vi/dictionary/english/provide) [support](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/vi/dictionary/english/support) and [advice](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/vi/dictionary/english/advice) to [people](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/vi/dictionary/english/people) [aged](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/vi/dictionary/english/aged) 50 and over. These shifts drive growth and innovation in healthcare, elderly care, and tourism.

However, the challenges posed by an aging population cannot be ignored. Governments face increased financial pressure as pension schemes and healthcare costs rise. Indeed, many developed countries are grappling with underfunded retirement systems due to the growing number of retirees. Furthermore, an aging population leads to a shrinking workforce, slowing economic growth. Consequently, industries like healthcare, elderly care, and tourism see growth due to rising demand, yet face labor shortages. This encourages automation and innovation to fill gaps, while creating opportunities in caregiving, medical technology, and senior services. Such shifts require targeted investments in workforce training and infrastructure to sustain long-term economic stability.

Despite these challenges, I believe the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. With effective policies, governments can mitigate the economic burden incurred by the aging population. It is undeniable that the wisdom and social contributions of elderly individuals are crucial in enriching communities and strengthening societal cohesion.

In conclusion, while an aging population presents some difficulties, its advantages are indicated in the fostering of social stability and economic growth. Accordingly, with strategic planning, including investments in workforce development and innovation, these challenges can be mitigated. One prime example is ….
