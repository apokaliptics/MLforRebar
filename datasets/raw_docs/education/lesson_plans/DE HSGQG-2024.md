**The Body Clock**

**CONTROL YOUR ANGER**

When a celebrity, a politician or other person in the media spotlight loses their temper in public, they run the risk of hitting the headlines in a most (**1.** **EMBARRASS**) \_\_\_embarrassing\_\_ way. For such (**2**. **CONTROL**) \_\_\_uncontrolled\_\_\_\_ outbursts of anger are often triggered by what seem to be trivial matters and, if they are caught on camera, can make people appear slightly (**3**. **RIDICULE**) \_ridiculous\_\_\_. But it’s not only the rich and famous who are prone to fits of rage. According to recent surveys, ordinary people are (**4**. **INCREASE**) \_increasingly\_\_ tending to lose their cool in public.

Yet anger is a potentially (**5. DESTROY**) \_\_\_destructive\_\_ emotion that uses up a lot energy and creates a high level of emotional and physical stress – and it stops us thinking rationally. (**6**. **CONSEQUENT**) \_\_\_Consequently\_\_\_, angry people often end up saying, and doing things they later have cause to regret.

So how can anger be avoided? Firstly, diet and lifestyle may be to blame. (**7. TOLERANT**) \_\_\_intolerance\_\_ and irritability certainly come to the surface when someone hasn’t slept properly and has skipped a meal, and any (**8. TAKE**) \_\_intake\_\_of caffeine can make things worse.

Taking regular exercise can help to ease and diffuse feelings of (**9. AGGRESSIVE**) \_\_aggression\_\_, however, reducing the chances of an angry response. But if something or someone does make you angry, it’s (**10. ADVISE**) \_\_\_advisable\_\_ not to react immediately. Once you’ve calmed down, things won’t look half as bad as you first thought.

**VOLUNTARY SERVICE OVERSEAS**

VSO (Voluntary Service Overseas) was always a great idea for people on their 20s, but what is less commonly known is that older volunteers are especially welcome. Today’s volunteer force includes many professions – teachers, nurses, midwives, boat-builders, physiotherapists, architects, solicitors and food technologists. Volunteers are aged between 20 and 70 – the average age is 33. There are roughly equal numbers of men and women and the great majority are single. However, between 15 and 20 percent of the volunteer force is made up couples.

VSO aims to relieve poverty by sending volunteers on two-year placements to work alongside people in less developed countries. Unlike other charities, VSO sends people, not money, to the country in need. It has been described as an organization that cares about the unequal distribution of material goods and opportunities in the world and, as former VSO director Neil McIntosh says, “VSO means caring about others – knowing that their deprivation diminishes us.” Since the first volunteers trekked out 30 years ago, more than 19,000 volunteers have now worked through Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and the Pacific, training the local workforce in vital skills.

For many people, VSO conjures up images of enthusiastic volunteers disappearing for two years into poverty-stricken areas, far from any form of civilization. But as VSO Operations Director Brian Rockliffe explains, the reality can be very different. “Many do end up working in places with no electricity or running water but, equally, many are allocated jobs in an environment similar to one back home. For example, some find work in a capital city, while others are employed in a university or clinic.”

So how are volunteers selected? Competition for the 750 places on offer each year is fierce – every day the VSO offices receive hundreds of enquiries from potential applicants. For this reason, VSO has introduced a rigorous selection procedure. This is deliberately testing, for VSO is not an easy option for drop-outs who fancy working abroad – the quality of volunteer is vital. The 8-page application form is the first stage of the application process. Next comes a one-day assessment, in which groups of applicants are put through tests to measure their motivation and ability to work well with others. Those accepted also go on a post-selection training and briefing weekend. Qualities looked for include adaptability, flexibility, open-mindedness and a willingness to learn. But the selection process isn’t infallible, and despite its rigours, ten percent of volunteers return home within nine months. Obviously, some return because of things going wrong back home, but a proportion find they just can’t take the lifestyle.

Most volunteers are sent out within six months of being accepted. Most are happy to go to any developing country and the more flexible they are, the sooner they will go. Each volunteer is given three grants – one before going, to equip him or herself, another to help settle in, and a final ‘re-equipment’ grant on return to this country. VSO sorts out work permits, pays National Insurance for volunteers and offers a scheme to compensate for loss of pension earnings. Salaries, which are generally intended to cover all basic living, are paid by the government of the host country, although in some cases these are so low that VSO supplements them. Outward and return flights are paid for by VSO and accommodation is found and paid for by the volunteer’s employers abroad.

Some volunteers stay for a third year and some marry while abroad and never come back. But the vast majority return home, though it’s not necessarily very easy to settle back into life back at home, as ex-volunteer Craig explains. “It’s so difficult to share your experiences with others. They express an interest and ask you to talk about it but they’re not really interested because they can’t relate to it.” For this reason, many volunteers stay in contact with each other after returning. “That’s also why couples who go together find it such a great experience,” says Craig, “because they have so many shared memories to talk about.”

VSO is definitely very hard work but the great plus is that, as well as having your own memories, your work can be said to have real, long-term results. So, who knows, maybe you could do it. You never know until you try…

1. When recruiting volunteers, VSO looks for \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

A. young single people. B. equal numbers of men and women.

***Does skiing have a future?***

In recent years, the sport of skiing has been having a tough time in Europe. A series of warm winters has meant skiers arriving at their destinations to find grass and daisies (1) \_\_where\_\_ there should have been snow. All over the continent, people have been questioning the wisdom (2) \_\_of\_\_\_developing any more low-level ski resorts, when even World Cup races at high levels have (3) \_\_needed\_\_ to be postponed for (4) \_\_lack\_\_ of snow.

Environmentalists might consider this rough justice, however. Ski resorts have always been considered (5) \_at best ecologically unfriendly. They cause forested mountainsides to be levelled and use up huge amounts of energy. (6) \_\_If\_ guaranteeing snow for skiers means more resorts at higher levels, then this will put even (7) \_\_\_more\_\_ pressure on fragile mountain ecosystems.

(8) \_\_\_While\_\_ artificial snow may be the answer to some of the ski industry’s problems, this too has its drawbacks. It weighs five times as (9) \_\_much\_\_\_ as real snow, something which can’t be that good for the mountain, (10) \_\_not\_\_ to mention the energy used up in creating the stuff; twenty million dollars worth was used in one US resort in one year alone.

**EUROPEAN TRANSPORT SYSTEMS 1990 -2010**

***What have been the trends and what are the prospects for European transport systems?***

**A.** It is difficult to conceive of vigorous economic growth without an efficient transport system. Although modern information technologies can reduce the demand for physical transport by facilitating teleworking and teleservices, the requirement for transport continues to increase. There are two key factors behind this trend. For passenger transport, the determining factor is the spectacular growth in car use. The number of cars on European Union (EU) roads saw an increase of three million cars each year from 1990 to 2010, and in the next decade the EU will see a further substantial increase in its fleet.

**B.** As far as goods transport is concerned, growth is due to a large extent to changes in the European economy and its system of production. In the last 20 years, as internal frontiers have been abolished, the EU has moved from a ‘stock’ economy to a ‘flow’ economy. This phenomenon has been emphasized by the relocation of some industries, particularly those which are labour intensive, to reduce production costs, even though the production site is hundreds or even thousands of kilometres away from the final assembly plant or away from users.

**C.** The strong economic growth expected in countries which are candidates for entry to the EU will also increase transport flows, in particular road haulage traffic. In 1998, some of these countries already exported more than twice their 1990 volumes and imported more than five times their 1990 volumes. And although many candidate countries inherited a transport system which encourages rail, the distribution between modes has tipped sharply in favour of road transport since the 1990s. Between 1990 and 1998, road haulage increased by 19.4%, while during the same period rail haulage decreased by 43.5%, although - and this could benefit the enlarged EU- it is still on average at a much higher level than in existing member states.

**D.** However, a new imperative - sustainable development - offers an opportunity for adapting the EU’s common transport policy. This objective, agreed by the Gothenburg European Council, has to be achieved by integrating environmental considerations into Community policies, and shifting the balance between modes of transport lies at the heart of its strategy. The ambitious objective can only be fully achieved by 2020, but proposed measures are nonetheless a first essential step towards a sustainable transport system which will ideally be in place in 30 years' time, that is by 2040.

**E.** In 1998, energy consumption in the transport sector was to blame for 28% of emissions of CO2, the leading greenhouse gas. According to the latest estimates, if nothing is done to reverse the traffic growth trend, CO2 emissions from transport can be expected to increase by around 50% to 1,113 billion tonnes by 2020, compared with the 739 billion tonnes recorded in 1990. Once again, road transport is the main culprit since it alone accounts for 84% of the CO2 emissions attributable to transport. Using alternative fuels and improving energy efficiency is thus both an ecological necessity and a technological challenge.

**F.** At the same time greater efforts must be made to achieve a modal shift. Such a change cannot be achieved overnight, all the less so after over half a century of constant deterioration in favour of road. This has reached such a pitch that today rail freight services are facing marginalisation, with just 8% of market share, and with international goods trains struggling along at an average speed of 18km/h. Three possible options have emerged.

**G.** The first approach would consist of focusing on road transport solely through pricing. This option would not be accompanied by complementary measures in the other modes of transport. In the short term it might curb the growth in road transport through the better loading ratio of goods vehicles and occupancy rates of passenger vehicles expected as a result of the increase in the price of transport. However, the lack of measures available to revitalise other modes of transport would make it impossible for more sustainable modes of transport to take up the baton.

**H.** The second approach also concentrates on road transport pricing but is accompanied by measures to increase the efficiency of the other modes (better quality of services, logistics, technology). However, this approach does not include investment in new infrastructure, nor does it guarantee better regional cohesion. It could help to achieve greater uncoupling than the first approach, but road transport would keep the lion's share of the market and continue to concentrate on saturated arteries, despite being the most polluting of the modes. It is therefore not enough to guarantee the necessary shift of the balance.

**Introducing choral music to children is like opening a door to a magical world**

Here’s an important question. What’s calming, therapeutic, healthier than drugs, and could well prolong your life? Answer: singing in a choir.

1. \_\_\_\_\_\_F\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

In fairness, there was a specific angle to this study, which compared the collective experience of choral singing to that of taking part in team sports. Choirs apparently win hands down, because there’s ‘a stronger sense of being part of a meaningful group’, related to ‘the synchronicity of moving and breathing with other people’. And as someone who since childhood has used singing as a refuge from the sports field, I take no issue with that.

2. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_B\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I know there are occasional initiatives. From time to time I get invited as a music critic to the launch of some scheme or other to encourage more collective singing among school-age children. There are smiles and brave words. Then, six months later, everything goes quiet – until the next launch of the next initiative.

3. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_G\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I know a woman who’s been trying hard to organize a performance of Benjamin Britten’s *Noye’s Fludde* – perhaps the greatest work ever devised for young children to sing together – as a tribute to the composer’s centenary this year. But has she found her local schools responsive? Sadly not: it was all too much trouble.

4. \_\_\_\_\_\_C\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

We sang Herbert Howells’s *Like as the Hart*. And whatever it did or didn’t do for my cardiovascular system, my emotional health, or any of the other things that turn up in research papers, it was the most significant experience of my childhood. It opened a world to which 11-year-olds from unfashionable parts of east London don’t generally get access. It was magical, transcendent. It spoke possibilities.

5. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_E\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

The other weekend I was in Suffolk, celebrating Britten, where in fact there were a lot of children privileged enough to be pulled into the centenary events. There was a great *Noye’s Fludde* in Lowestoft. And on the actual birthday countless hordes of infant voices piled into Snape Maltings to sing Britten’s school songs, *Friday Afternoons*, part of a project that involved 100,000 others, internationally, doing likewise.

6. \_\_\_\_\_\_\_A\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Just think: if we could finally get Britain’s children singing, it would filter upwards. And we wouldn’t need university researchers. We’d just do it, and be all the better for it.

**A**. It was an extraordinary experience that many of those children will carry with them all their lives, like my experience all those years ago. There’s a plan for it to be repeated every year on Britten’s birthday. But that will only happen if there are resources and sustained commitment (for a change).

**B**. In fact, I have no argument with any of these piles of research – bring them on, the more the better – because what they have to say is true. The only thing I find annoying is that such an endlessly repeated truth results in relatively little action from the kind of people who could put it to good use.

**C**. One of my enduring life regrets is that I never got the chance to take part in such an event as a child. I guess I went to schools where it was also too much trouble. But I did, just once, aged 11, get the chance to go with a choir and sing at Chelmsford Cathedral.

**D**. But being there was even better. And as I was sitting near the choir – who were magnificent – I saw the faces of the boys and thought how fabulously privileged they were to have this opportunity given to them.

**E**. And that, for me, is what a choir can offer. All the physical and mental pluses are a happy bonus. But the joy and thrill of access to that world of music is what counts.

**F.** It’s not a new discovery: there are endless dissertations on the subject, libraries of research, and celebrity endorsements. But people have short memories. So every time another academic paper is published, it gets into the news – which was what happened this week when Oxford Brookes University came up with the latest ‘singing is good for you’ revelation.

**G.** The hard fact is that most state schools don’t bother much with singing, unless someone in the hierarchies of government steps in to make it worth their while. They say they don’t have the resources or the time. And even when a worthwhile singing project drops into their lap, they turn it down.

**PRESS COMPLAINTS COMMISSION**

**CODE OF PRACTICE**

All members of the press have a duty to maintain the highest professional and ethical standards. In doing so, they should have regard to the provisions of this code of practice and to safeguarding the public’s right to know.

Editors are responsible for the actions of journalists employed by their publications. They should also satisfy themselves as far as possible that material was obtained in accordance with this code.

**A.**

**-** Newspapers and periodicals should take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted material. - Whenever it is recognized that a significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distorted report has been published, it should be corrected promptly and with due prominence.

- An apology should be published whenever appropriate.

- A fair opportunity for reply to inaccuracies should be given to individuals or organizations when reasonably called for.

- Newspapers, whilst free to be partisan, should distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.

**B.**

**-** Intrusions and enquiries into an individual’s private life without his or her consent are not generally acceptable and publication can only be justified when in the public interest. This would include: detecting or exposing crime or serious misdemeanor; detecting or exposing seriously anti-social conduct; protecting public health and safety; preventing the public from being misled by some statement or action of that individual.

- Journalists or photographers making enquiries at hospitals or similar institutions should identify themselves to a responsible official and obtain permission before entering non-public areas.

- The restrictions on intruding into privacy are particularly relevant to inquiries about individuals in hospitals or similar institutions.

**C.**

**-** Journalists should not generally obtain or seek to obtain information or pictures through misrepresentation or trickery.

- Unless in the public interest, documents or photographs should be removed only with the express consent of the owner.

- Trickery can be justified only in the public interest and only when material cannot be obtained by any other means.

- In all these clauses, the public interest is defined as in B above.

- Journalists should neither obtain nor seek to obtain information or pictures through intimidation.

- Unless their inquiries are in the public interest, journalists should not photograph individuals or private property without their consent, should not persist in telephoning or questioning individuals after having been asked to leave, and should not follow them.

- The public interest is as in B above.

**D.**

**-** Payments or offers of payment for stories, pictures or information should not be made to witnesses or potential witnesses in current criminal proceedings or to people engaged in crime or to their associates except where the material concerned ought to be published in the public interest and the payment is necessary for this to be done. The public interest is defined in B above.

- “Associates” include family, friends, neighbors and colleagues.

- Payments should not be made either directly or indirectly through agents.

- In cases involving personal grief or shock, inquiries should be carried out and approaches made with sympathy and discretion.

- The Press should generally avoid identifying relatives or friends of persons convicted or accused of crime unless the reference to them is necessary for the full, fair and accurate reporting of the crime or legal proceedings.

**E.**

**-** The Press should avoid prejudicial or pejorative reference to a person’s race, color, religion or sex or to any physical or mental illness or handicap.

- It should avoid publishing details of a person’s race color, religion or sex unless these are directly relevant to the story.

- Even where the law does not prohibit it, journalists should not use for their own profit financial information they receive in advance of its general publication, nor should they pass such information to others.

- They should not write about shares or securities in whose performance they know that they or their close families have a significant financial interest, without disclosing the interest to the editor or financial editor.

- They should not buy or sell, either directly or through nominees or agents, shares or securities about which they have written recently or about which they intend to write in the near future.

- Journalists have a moral obligation to protect confidential sources of information.
