| **Hao** | The bar graph compares the annual work hours of primary, lower secondary and upper secondary school teachers in 4 different countries in 2001.  Overall, upper secondary teachers worked the most hours across 4 surveyed countries in 2001 while primary teachers worked the least.  Regarding the United States, American teachers taught the most hours in 2001 compared to other surveyed countries. To put in perspective, the highest and second highest recorded figures were for upper and lower secondary school teachers in the US, at 1200 and 1000 hours per teacher respectively. American primary educators also worked the most compared to primary teachers from other surveyed nations, at 750 hours each.  Upper secondary teachers in Iceland and Spain both taught around 900 hours per person in 2001. Meanwhile, Icelandic primary and lower secondary pedagogues taught the fewest hours among all surveyed categories, at around 600 hours each.    Japanese primary school teachers taught the same number of hours in 2001 as their lower secondary peers in Iceland while the Japanese lower secondary equivalent each worked 50 more hours in comparison. | **Country grouped**  **Overall chưa đủ**  **10/10** |
| **Son** | The bar graph compares the yearly pedagogical work hours of primary, lower secondary and upper secondary of 4 different countries in 2001.  Overall, teachers of upper secondary have to work the most hours in all surveyed countries as opposed to primary teachers, with the US constituting the highest work hours across all three categories.  Upon closer inspection, America possessed the largest figure for both upper and lower secondary work-hours, the latter being the second-highest overall, at 1190 and 1000 respectively. US primary pedagogical work hours also constituted the most out of all countries, with 740 hours.  In contrast, Japanese teachers had to work the fewest hours with regard to the upper secondary, not even surpassing US’s primary hours. Whereas, Icelandic teachers boasted the fewest number of work hours in terms of primary and lower secondary.  Iceland and Spain’s upper secondary pedagogues both accounted for roughly 900 hours, slightly lower than the figure for American lower secondary. | **Country-based**  **Dùng constitute trong bar graph**  **👍 10/15**  **America also possessed the highest figure for primary**  **Why not state the highest recorded figure instead**  **Fourth paragraph had no figure**  **Approximation**  **Why compare Iceland and Spain’s upper second with America’s lower** |
| **Linh Anh** | The bar chart compares the number of hours dedicated to teaching annually in three educational levels , gauged in four different countries in 2001.  Overall, there was an upward trend in the number of hours taught by teachers every year upon reaching higher educational levels. Noticeably, the most prominent across four countries belonged to upper secondary, as opposed to primary sector.  Upon closer inspection, in the USA, an average teacher in upper secondary level spent nearly 1200 hours every year on tutoring in 2001, which was 200 hours and 250 hours higher than secondary and primary teachers respectively. Additionally, the teaching hours per year in the USA registered in all levels took the top-notch position of all four surveyed countries.  In contrast, teachers in Japan allocated the least time for teaching in upper secondary level, with 700 hours per year. Upon inspecting lower levels, there was a decrease of 50 hours spent on working at lower secondary and primary correspondingly.  Meanwhile, in Iceland, there was a wide discrepancy of 300 hours between upper secondary schools and lower secondary schools, with roughly 900 hours spent by upper secondary teachers. In comparison, Spain shared the same figure for upper secondary. | Country-based  fine ig  8/10 |
| **Bao** | The graph shows the volume of instruction provided to students, measured in hours, in elementary, lower secondary, and upper secondary schools in four distinct nations.  Overall, teachers in America constituted the highest teaching hours in all three categories with upper secondary educators contributing the most in all four surveyed countries, as opposed to their primary counterparts.  A closer analysis reveals that American teachers topped the chart in terms of teaching hours with upper secondary educators putting in close to 1200 hours, while their lower secondary equivalents also put in 1000 hours each. Furthermore, despite only contributing close to two -third of that upper secondary teachers, the teaching hours of primary educators still topped said category at around 750 hours.  Both Spanish and Icelandic upper secondary teachers constituted around 900 hours each. Moreover, the latter’s primary and lower secondary counterparts recorded the lowest figures for each category, both at around 600 hours.  It should be noted that Japan had the lowest disparity in terms of teaching hours between all categories, with all sitting between 600 and 700 hours. | (Country-based) |
| **Lam** | The bar chart illustrates the aggregate working hours of teachers employed in different types of educational institutions from four distinct nations in 2001.  Overall, teaching at higher education stages required clocking in for longer hours. Additionally, educators in the US had the greatest workload, as opposed to those in Japan.  Further analysis reveals that Japan, Spain and Iceland had many resembling features, namely in the Primary sector where all three had around 600 teaching hours to within 50 hours. Likewise, Iceland and Japan had comparable amounts of time in the Lower Secondary category at 600-650 hours. Furthermore, only a small gap of approximately 20 was seen between the time taught by teachers at Upper Secondary schools in Iceland and Spain, with the former being the lower at 900 hours.  Regarding the USA, it had the most significant figures across the chart, the most pronounced being the hours of teaching in the Upper Secondary institutions, at 1.5 times that of Spain. The Primary and Lower Secondary sectors of the US also overshadowed those of the remaining nations by around 100 and 300, respectively. | country-based  As opposed to their japanese colleagues  It is a bit confusing when comparing 3 countries in the same paragraph,  Claimed that USA has the most significant figures but didn’t include any  7/10 |
| **Kiet** | The bar chart demonstrates the teaching hours per annum by a teacher across four distinct nations in certain stages of education in the first year of the 21st century.  Overall, the hours accumulated by US educators was the highest, contrary to that of Japan’s. Moreover, as the educational phases progressed, the requisite number of hours increased.  Upon closer inspection, USA registered the peak teaching hours in all categories of education at an average of 1000 hours for each group. Additionally, the Upper Secondary group recorded the top figure at approximately 200 above the average hours. In contrast, Japanese educators taught the least hours annually, beginning at half the peak hours of US teachers with a 50-hour margin between each education section.  As for the remaining countries, both Spanish and Icelandic teachers had the approximate equivalent working hours for the Upper Secondary section, registering roughly 900 hours. However, the discrepancy in the teaching hours between two regions in the other 2 categories was around 100 hours, where Spain was the superior area. (170 words) | **Country-based** |
| **Tue** | The given line graph compares four nations in terms of the educational hours allocated by teachers in three different levels of education in 2001.  Overall, it is noticeable that while the highest number of hours devoted to teaching went to Upper Secondary teachers, the opposite was true for Primary ones. Additionally, the USA occupied the leading position in all surveyed categories.  A closer inspection of the line chart indicates a similar pattern between the USA and Spain which both saw a significant gap among three educational levels. In 2001, Upper Secondary teachers in America allocated roughly 1200 hours teaching, compared to only 900 hours of Spanish educators. This category witnessed 200 hours higher than the Lower Secondary in both nations. However the discrepancy between Upper Secondary and Primary level in the USA was wider than that of Spain, at around 450 hours compared to 250 hours.  As for the remaining countries, both Japan and Iceland recorded the figures for their Lower and Upper Secondary ranging around 600 hours alongside a minor difference between these two categories. However, while Upper Secondary teachers in Japan spent the record low class time at exactly 700 hours, that of their Icelandic counterparts was around 200 hours higher, at slightly over 900 hours.

| **Vi** | The bar chart compares the hours of work each teacher did in 2001 in Japan, Spain, Iceland, and the USA.  Overall, upper secondary teachers had the most work hours in all surveyed nations, in which those from the USA topped the charts.  Upon closer inspection, all USA teachers put in the most teaching hours than the rest. Upper secondary teachers accounted for 1200 in 2001 while lower secondary and primary teachers had 1000 and 750 hours respectively. Meanwhile, Japan’s figures ranged from 600 to 700 hours with upper secondary teachers having the most and primary teachers having the least hours of teaching.  Regarding the two remaining countries, upper secondary facilitators in Spain and Iceland possessed a similar amount of teaching hours of 900. Teachers from lower secondary and primary schools in Spain taught more hours than those in Iceland. In fact, over 600 hours were spent teaching primary students in Spain while Iceland only had above 500, and more than 700 hours were dedicated to teaching lower secondary pupils in Spain in contrast to Iceland’s figure of 600.  (178 words) | Country-based |
| **Phuc** | The given bar chart delineates the number of teaching hours per annum of teachers in four countries. Data are gauged in primary, lower secondary, upper secondary education in 2001.  Overall, higher level education prerequisites more pedagogical working hours and this fasion was most pronounced in Spain and USA. Additionally, working hours for teachers were prevalently high in the Us as opposed to Japan.  Upon a closer inspection, 600 hours or whereabouts were allocated for primary teaching n Japan, Spain, Iceland. The corresponding working hours for lower secondary teachers were relatively identical compared to their primary counterparts’ worktim in Japan and Iceland. However, the number of pedagogical working hours for lower secondary teachers exceeded 700 hours, being the second-highest overall. Progressing to upper secondary education, up to 900 hours were committed by pedagogues in Spain and Iceland, exceeding their Japan colleagues by 200 hours on average.  Apropos of America, teaching hours in all level of education were the highest, evidenced by 700 hours allocated for primary teaching. Moreover, the gap of teaching hours spent by pedagogues between America and the remaining nations was most pronounced in secondary level of education. Accordingly, teachers reportedly spent 1000 and 1200 hours for lower secondary and upper secondary teaching and the two categories both surpiassed the figures of average teaching hours in Spain by 300. In stark contrast, the equivalent figures for all three categories were lowest with the exception of lower secondary number, progressing from 600 to 700 hours in three consecutive levels of education. | **Hybrid**  **Overall mentioned no educational levels**  **Too many spelling and grammar mistakes**  **unnecessary** |

**HW2: Idea development (Outline)**

In the modern world, **schools** are no longer necessary because there is so much information available through **the Internet** that children can study just as well at **home**. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

| Name | Outline | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hao | View 1: Going to school is still necessary for children   * Teacher guidance: Teachers: more experienced and well-versed than students in school subjects and social as well as legal matters.   => Educators can assist students in curating information for learning on the internet.   * Children can develop interpersonal and communication skills in the school environment. * At home: Only family members * At school: Interact with classmates and teachers => Facilitates friendship and meaningful bonds with more people => ensure emotional development of the students   View 2: Students can study at home   * The preponderance of the knowledge taught in schools are readily available on the internet. * There are already digital websites and programs that can emulate physical classrooms:   E.g: K12 online is a website where teachers can host online classes and hold exams for students.  Concession: Online videos can never substitute human interactions => Reliant on video learning can lead to worsened communication skills in students  E.g: Students rarely interact with other people when they study at home => deteriorate verbal and body language skills  Students cannot participate in sports when they are confined in their homes.  => School is still necessary. |  |
|  | Par1: Homeschooling is a viable option   * The abundance of information, lessons and knowledge can provide students with sufficient education. * Online schoolings are becoming increasingly popular, and can replace offline classes in some aspects. * Ease of access, and students can study courses at their own pace.   Par2: Formal schooling is still better   * Better structured learning environment, since schools provide a disciplined and rigid environment, helping students in scheduling and feedback * Teachers are experienced and can provide a specialized teaching regiment and a more personalized support * Holistic approach, since schools not only focus on academic performance but also opportunities for students * Schools provide a platform for students to collaborate and cooperate with each other, as well as a way to interact with others of diverse backgrounds   Concession: Study via the Internet is never going to be as good as by the school, but utilizing both methods of learning can reap the benefits of each approach without their drawbacks. |  |
| Linh Anh | My opinion: partially agree  Paragraph 1: The abundance of information available on the internet  Topic sentence: On the one hand, the emergence of internet has substantially enhance the quality of education overall.  - The ability to customise one’s learning experience => create a more comprehensive learning environment for students => accumulate knowledge much easier and more swiftly  - The large number of online courses => for example: Khan Academy => make education available for more individuals.  Paragraph 2: The significance of educational institutes  Topic sentence: On the other hand, school still retains several benefits for their attendees.  -School provide a collaborative and competitive learning environment => promote students’ desire to thrive and study  -Some resources provided by school is not readily available on the network => a prestige only school gives => create an advantage for those who attend schools  Paragraph 3: My opinion => Internet should be a supplement for education, not a replacement => a tool for researching and expanding children’s knowledge  Conclusion: While the internet has revolutionised the access to information, schools remain an imperative part in the modern world => provide environment and resources to support the development of children |  |
| Lam | Partly agree.  View 1: Myriad justifications can be cited to support the claim that studying at home via the net can make schools obsolete as it is equally efficient in educating children.    - Encourage self-growth in juveniles-> studying at home usually means having to research their own materials-> a freedom of choice to study a preferred subject-> more motivation and drive to do tasks-> improve diligence and self-discipline.  - Abundance of information on a variety of fields, not confined to just textbooks-> more diversity in knowledge-> just as or even more effective in bringing out talents.  Concession: Guidance is needed to achieve optimal progress in studies, children tend to be irresponsible and might slack off if not supervised.  View 2: I would argue that educational institutions are still a key factor in nurturing the future generations of modern society for many reasons.  - Teachers’ pedagogical skills are needed, especially for children who are still coming of age-> Guidance is indispensable for those who are just starting out and are lost on where to begin-> Schools provide such vision through means of teaching fundamental understandings.  - Schools are superior to cyberspace in a few facets:  + The first is the filtering of materials-> textbooks have gone through censorship to ensure appropriate and valid knowledge is taught to students, the Internet is an open space->no prior authentication-> misinformation and unsuitable contents.  + The second is safety, the Internet is filled with predators running amok-> likely to come across if not monitored closely-> may put the welfare of children at risk, whereas the personnel of an institution must meet certain criteria-> safer.  + Finally, the environment inspires students to have real human interactions and prioritize collaboration, contrary to the at home approach where the only interactions are through a screen, and at times would cause one to feel isolated from society.  Concession: Some aspects may seem redundant such as excessive testing-> causing burnouts and physical fatigue. Scoring children based on unrealistic metrics-> begetting stress and peer pressure-> detrimental to adolescents’ mental health. |  |
| Vi | Part 1: Homeschool via online platforms.   * A myriad of sources across the Internet -> Unverified -> Unreliable -> Students lack the ability to accurately determine the necessary materials -> Feel confused and discouraged to study.   Part 2: Attending school   * Organized teaching -> consistent curriculum with pre planned lessons designed by experts -> intellectual development. * Aid in the development of social skills -> Children have the opportunity to communicate and work with peers -> Increased cooperation and communication skills.   Conclusion: In conclusion, while homeschooling certainly does have its merits, I contend with the idea that students should attend schools so that they develop pivotal skills and receive quality education. |  |
| Tue | **Firmly agree**  To commence with, mere homeschooling through the Internet can hinder students’ learning progress. Although the Internet can offer students a wealth of information and knowledge in interesting forms, they may be bewildered at the colossal amount of information available and thus not know what is the right thing to acquire. In the worse scenarios, students might also run the risk of absorbing false or distorted knowledge, which could be undoubtedly detrimental to their academic development. This disadvantage can be remedied by schools where curriculum and syllabus are well-designed and taught by competent teachers. This can somewhat ensure that students’ acquisition of knowledge is as effective as possible. laying the groundwork for their further scholastic development.  Furthermore, schools can act as catalysts to the communal relationships between young learners and their peers. This is mainly because schools can provide both formal and informal settings for face-to-face interaction. For example, at schools, learners have an opportunity to socialize not only in academic classes but also through extracurricular activities. This will enable them to form social relationships and hone personal skills namely communication, which the Internet and social media platforms may fail to offer. If armed with this skill set, students will be better equipped to cope with this ever-changing world and hence become capable citizens later in life | E quên mất là viết outline nên e viết full bài luôn á cô huhu |
| Bao | Passage 1: There are many merits to self-studying via the Internet   * There is a myriad of information available on the internet * Students can decide what they want to learn and learn at their own pace * Self-studying encourages independence as students are responsible for their own academic success.   However,   * There exists a lot of false and unreliable information on the Internet. This can be harmful if students are unable to filter them out. * Self-studying does not provide students with social skills that they can acquire at schools (communication, teamwork and leadership skills)   Passage 2: Educational institutions are still indispensable to the growth of students   * The guidance of educators are indispensable, especially to those who are inept in studying.   Ex:+ an experienced teacher is able to filter out and transmit information effectively.   * Teachers can provide assistance in ways that do not hinder students’ thought process and creativity -> further enhancing cognitive abilities. * Schools provide students with opportunities to socialize and make lifelong bonds with others, while improving their interpersonal abilities   In conclusion, while the advantages of the Internet make it possible for some to study on their own, I believe that schools are still crucial to the development of students. |  |
| Phuc | Disgree  Body 1: Internet still manifests multiple innate pitfalls and even induce adverse implications for education   * Information circulating on the Internet are not authentic and highly unstructured.   → Ragbag understanding typical in self-learning of a province can yet match the well-devised body provided by mainstream education   * Many students can yet possess the prerequisites wherewithals and accoutrements to leverage the Internet.   Placing technology-illiterate pupils or those residing in far-fetched regions at a disadvantages.  Furthermore, while internet does offer some recognized advantages, many students are yet too immature to harness the capabilities of the Internet  Last, as Internet are bristled with misinformation, targeted ads, blashphemous, sacrilegious contents.  → students have a proclivity to seek aforementioned ills rather than actually studying  Body 2: Despite the encroaching influence of the internet, schools still have palpable value in contemporary society.  → Teacher’s guidance and emotional support  → Sure-footed approach to learning as everyone can learn the same material, ensuring progress → opposed to the capricious nature of the internet  –. Interpersonal skills and handwriting  → Disciplines and work politics (introduced early in schools)  Counter: Many people opine that courses on the internet along with the advent of AI can culminate in the demolition of mainstream education. While self-learning aided by the Internet is feasible, the concept of learning merely through the internet can yet match the all-rounded, sure-footed experiences offered by schools.  → Only a few exceptional individuals can substitute traditional schools for self-learning while the general mass still have to rely to traditional schools  Furthermore, given the far-reaching repercussion of Internet including a highly virutal world, reclusive mindset rampant in youngsters, Internet will only ruin the progress of studying itself, let alone replacing mainstream education. |  |

**28 November 2023 - Lesson 6**

**Check-in session: One lesson I could learn from my family members**

**Time: 3h23**

| **Name** | **Paragraph writing** | **Comments** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Son | One useful advice that I could heed from my family members would be of my older brother’s. He always tells me to pursue my own dreams regardless of other people’s expectations, and to never give up. He himself dedicated his high school and college years to pursuing his own aspirations and hoped that I would do the same. As a student, I have been staying true to this belief and chasing after my own interests in life. However, I still have to overcome my own laziness and indolence, alongside eliminating the desire to attain validation from others. Only by conquering these challenges will I be able to fully pursue my dreams. |  |
| Bao | Of all the things I could learn from members of my family, I believe that picking up culinary skills from my mother would be the most beneficial for me. The primary reason for this is the fact that I will soon move out to further pursue education, and being able to cook for myself would be greatly advantageous for me. First of all, it will allow me to keep a healthy diet and satisfy my nutritional needs wherever I am. Moreover, having the ability to cook would also be very economical as I would not need to eat out every time. Furthermore, learning to cook would also greatly increase my sense of independence while also lessening the emotional burden that is placed on my parents when I am away. Despite having zero to no experience in the art of culinary, I am still determined to learn it. |  |
| Hao | One lesson I could learn from my parents is their dedication to knowledge. As a student, I believe studying skills are currently the most important for me to acquire. However, I struggle with time management and procrastination, leading me to be overly unproductive at times. On the other hand, my parents are able to continue learning new things despite their old age and busy schedules as office workers in a state-owned company. They are able to research multiple topics that interest them in their little free time. To illustrate, my father routinely studies Eastern philosophies such as Buddhism and Confucianism in his free time while my mother hones her sewing and designing skills. To them, learning new things is a personal hobby that they enjoy. Meanwhile, I still dread going to school everyday and doing my homework. If I could cultivate the same mindset for learning as my parents, I would be able to organise my studying more and approach learning with excitement instead of procrastinating. |  |
| L Anh | One thing that I have learned from my family members, especially my parents, is the behavioural lessons in life. Every time we gather around after dinner, my parents always spend time lecturing me about how to properly behave myself in public. Personally, they taught me the slightest things that I need to know in life such as table manners and family etiquette. Additionally, through observing my parents’ attitude, I have learned quite a sum. Thanks to that, it dawned on me the importance of self-behaviour management because without proper manners, people will consider us to be rude and undereducated. The Vietnamese also put great emphasis on traditional manners, therefore, it is crucial that I grasp all these pieces of knowledge. Those valuable lessons have turned me into a well-mannered person. However, I still sometimes act on impulse and misbehave, which makes my parents’ blood boil so I suppose I still have room to improve. |  |
| Lam | My sister and father both have experiences when it comes to economics and leadership skills, and those are what I desire to learn from them most. The reasoning behind this is when I was little, my dad worked as an executive at a local enterprise, and watching him work with his employees had instilled in me a drive to become a leader, someone that others look up to. Economics was just a subject that I had general interest in and wanted to pursue, and the same was true for my sister who went to university and majored in international business. As an aspiring economist, I have much to learn about how the world functions and although digital sources are available, I much rather prefer to take lessons from those closest to me because I know that they are always considerate and open to any questions I might have. Consequently, hearing them lecture me about the ins and outs of economics and leadership had opened my mind to new and exciting knowledge, ones that I could never have figured out myself, and for that I am thankful and grateful for them. |  |
| Vi | A precious lesson I could learn from my family was Mathematics. I used to be a stubborn and rebellious child, always in hiding whenever I had to study or go to primary school. It did not help that my teacher was extremely cranky and used traditional methods to discipline pupils. Maybe, because of that, I despised learning maths even more because I vividly remember my amusement when my mother taught me the fun in studying it. What she did was that she used colourfully decorated sticks to help me do addition and subtraction. Her methods of putting the fun in maths were by far more creative than the dull lessons with my teacher. It was the first time that I got excited with learning and was also what got me into finding the creativity behind every subject. The lesson from my mother impacted me immensely and led me on to the path of becoming a teacher. |  |
| Kiet | The most valuable skill I learned from both my mother and father is how to manage my finances. Back then, I used to question my parents’ strictness regarding our finances. As I got older, my parents explained the essential principles and the reason behind it. At that point, it dawned on me that we did not have enough financial security and these little savings were helping my family afford my expenses and necessities for the family. Thanks to their teaching, I have been able to save up for my favourite items and set aside some money for emergencies. This has given me the freedom to enjoy the benefits of purchasing my desired things without worrying about financial instability. |  |
| Tue | One valuable lesson that I can learn from my family members is the quality of being resilient in the face of adversity. Whether the challenges were financial setbacks, health issues or personal struggles, they were always able to rise to the occasion. This quality has undoubtedly instilled in me a thought that setbacks are opportunities for personal growth and development. After all, the ability to bounce back in any adverse circumstance of my family has provided me many invaluable lessons, continuing to shape my mindset. |  |
| Phuc | Family is indubitaly a sacrosanct aspect of my life, particularly for me as the youngest member in my family. Given their overwhelming influence over my life trajectory, my family has imparted a multitide of lessons for me, most notably of which comes from my sister. My sister is the first one in the family to experience the hectic nature and various ramifications of metropolitan lifestyles, more specifically the city that never sleeps – Saigon. Although her influence on me is not explicitly expressed nor did she ever exhort me anything, I still appreciate and try to emulate her success, her streetwise skills and laudable resilience. To illuminate, my sister managed to get a university degree in linguistics while juggling multiple extra jobs to ensure my family’s financial security. Furthermore, one notable achievement of my sister is that she procured a 6.5 ielts benchmark, which is highly venerated considered the lackadaisical popularity of english at that time. As these aforementioned achievements are ostensibly the vindication of my sister unimpeded devotion and capabilities, my sister is surely the proud of my family. From her, I learn a lot of laudable personality traits, evidently her resilence, stamina and indefagitable qiddites. Moreover, I deduce that success in life would eventually come if you apply yourself to a certain degree. Albeit the fact that I barely remain contact with my sister present-day, my sister is still the luminary for me regarding my pursuit for english proficiency and the quest of becoming a mature human-being |  |

| --- | --- | --- |
| Son | Topic sentence: there are various reasons on why letting the youth the freedom of making mistakes can be justified  Par1: freedom of choice   * Foster children’s creative and imaginative aptitude as they do trial-and-error -> promotes experimentation -> develops a malleable, plastic mindset in the long run, capable of adapting to any circumstances * Bolster independence by not being guided all the way through -> leads to self-discipline, self-confidence in oneself -> promotes responsibility in oneself * Learning mistakes first-hand -> help them learn from them better than with a vicarious approach   Par2: adult preclusion   * Young people are usually not old enough for legal matters, so adults have to step in * Some mistakes are too severe to learn directly (car safety, swimming), so a second-hand method works better and more safe * Parents can pass down their own mistakes from their own experiences -> richer, and more diverse * Adults act as guardians, guiding the youth -> avoid pitfalls or undesirable consequences from making mistakes   Par3: opinion: a balanced approach where both experimentation and regulations are endorsed -> reap both approach’s benefits while minimising the potential drawbacks | * Some types of mistakes shouldn’t be made by the youth * Moral and ethical * Mistake with heavy consequences * Reputational (remarks about friends, emotional bullying) * Unnecessary harm (fire) * The youth often does not learn from their mistakes, so why bother letting them do so -> may lead to habitual erring/ may lead to them not trying to avoid making mistakes * The preclusion of young people from freely erring prevents them from growing independently -> stunting their creative aptitude and make them less self-reliant and more dependent -> lack of originality * May lead to a lack of self-trust, making them less confident when dealing with certain situations |
| Lam | Para 1: **Myriad justifications can be cited to support the prerogative of the youth to make mistakes.**  · Learn to take responsibility for their own mistakes as the consequences will be directly affecting them-> develop into self-discipline that will inevitably have to be attained in the future.  · Instills open-mindedness -> not restricted by regulations and rules-> allowed to roam around and discover new things.   * The right to freely make mistakes can be conducive to increasing adaptability to any given task-> beneficial for problem-solving and critical thinking.   Para 2: Mature people should intervene with the mistake-making of adolescents.  · indelible consequences heavily influence, especially during the chaotic period of adolescence -> vulnerable to social maladies: smoking or alcoholism -> adult prevention is necessary since grown-ups possess the role of guidance, showing those who come after the correct path.  · The previous generation is more adept with the legality of certain errors, so they can assist youngins to avoid undesirable gaffes. Ex: In family context.  Opinion:  Both play important roles and are irreplaceable components of a child’s life-> equilibrated approach should be employed in order to reap the benefits of both methods, neither fettering children nor being indifferent to their mischiefs. | * The young erring without judgements or punishments may lead to them developing ignorance, thinking that their actions have no ramifications-> destructive personality. * No punitive measures-> repeated mistakes, exploiting and forming bad habits-> cannot improve or might even degrade existing capabilities. * Guardians preventing juniors from making mistakes may result in overprotectiveness-> disabling their creativity and abating their interaction with the world-> when they finally grow up, they will be inexperienced and may crumble under the pressures of modern society. |
| Bao | **Passage 1: Freedom to Make Mistakes**  **There are many justifications for the youths’ freedom to make mistakes**  Learning Experience  - Mistakes are crucial for learning and personal development.  - Provide examples illustrating how mistakes contribute to the acquisition of valuable life skills.  Autonomy and Independence  - Allowing young people to make decisions independently.  - Autonomy fosters a sense of responsibility and self-reliance.  Resilience and Adaptability  - Mistakes play a major role in building resilience and independence.  - Overcoming challenges enhances adaptability and problem-solving skills.  **Passage 2: Prevention by Adults**  - Some mistakes can have severe consequences, necessitating adult intervention.  - Repeatedly making mistakes may put the young in precarious situations.  - Limiting the amount of mistakes is needed to optimise the youths’ personal growth  - Adults have the responsibility to lead by example for their superior amount of experience  **Passage 3: Conclusion**  - I believe that a balanced approach would be most appropriate | * Making mistakes without consequences may condition the young to be irresponsible with their actions   —-------------------------------------------     * Excessive intervention may hinder the young’s personal growth, detracting them from their interests or hobbies   Ex: +a child may be forced to give up their dream to follow their parent’s footsteps.  + The youth could be discouraged from doing certain things due to adults’ preconceptions. (dying your hair, pursuing peculiar careers,...)   * Overprotectiveness can lead to over dependence on adults. |
| Linh Anh | **View 1: Young people should be free to make mistakes**  Topic sentence: **Youngsters’ freedom to make mistakes can be justified for a number of reasons**  Supporting ideas:  + The freedom to make mistakes can help new generations **develop perseverance** to achieve a goal without being judged. They grow up more resilient to failure when making mistakes from time to time => they are not demoralized when confronted with obstacles.  .  Ex: Solving a maths problem : requires time and effort put in and multiple errors have to be made prior to reaching the final answer. Young adults who are used to mistakes are more likely to invest more than those who are not  + Through mistakes, **valuable lessons** can be drawn, helping children to ameliorate and create a better version of themselves  Ex: Developing cognitive and more effective problem-solving skills through past experiences  **View 2: making mistakes freely should be prevented through adult’s intervention**  + The aid of more experienced adults is necessary for the youth to acknowledge mistakes and amend those  Reasons: youngsters are vulnerable and impressionable => severe mistakes sometimes can be detrimental to their development.  => requires the aid of more experienced adults for the youth to acknowledge mistakes and amend those  Ex: accidentally befriending bad friends => exposed to harmful influences.  + Adults' interference could orient children on the right track and shield them from bad influences, avoiding discouragement from the main target in life.  **Opinion:** Mistakes can be of crucial importance in nurturing young people. However, the amount of mistakes made should be under scrutiny and controlled to a appropriate extent by guardians to avoid unwanted side effects | * Freedom to mistake-making can discourage juveniles from avoiding mistakes since they develop the misconception that the act of making mistakes is acceptable => counter effective * Making errors should be restricted to a minimal number => the free to make mistakes can eradicate this barrier and make youngster more susceptible to making irreversible and undesirable flaws   Adults should not avert the freedom to make mistakes.   * Intervention could deprive young people of sense of independence * Excessive control from adults could hinder youngsters’ development |
| Kiet | **View 1:** Freedom to make mistakes  **Topic sentence:** **There exist various justifications why the youth should be given the autonomy in making mistakes.**  **Supporting ideas:**  **-Idea 1:** Process of trial and error and help develop resillience and problem-solving skills => cope with the struggles and challenges of the real world.  **-Idea 2**: Promote creativity => children and adults are different in way of thinking => ex: In the book “The little prince”, it is said that most adults can not see the hidden elephant eaten by the boa and they interpret it as a hat.  **View 2:** Intervention of adults  **Main idea:** Grown-up individuals should curtail the liberty of young people for several reasons.  **Supporting ideas:**  **-Idea 1:** The experience of mature individuals can help guide and support youngsters => prevent them from making the same mistakes and make better decision => reach their full potential  **-Idea 2:** Certain activities are hazardous => Children are inquisitive and impressionable individuals => the inference of grown-ups can help prevent such issues => example: several children was burnt due to their curiosity of the cigarette lighter in a car.  **Opinion:** Should strike a balance between the freedom to explore and the interference of adults => should only allow children to discover within reasonable boundaries with approval from experienced individuals => promote inquisitiveness with a safety net to fall through. | -**The freedom to err as adolescents can put themselves in dangerous situations recklessly.** The culprit for this behaviour is the inquisitiveness and carelessness of youngsters.  -Blundering can be emotionally distressing for the young generation if lack the support to cope with these setbacks. Consequently, perpetual errors can infuriate young people and lead to feelings of inadequacy, coupled with low self-esteem.  -The intervention of adults should be limited as they can hinder the youth’s independence and self-learning, which can ensure sustainable development throughout their life.  -Some mature individuals take advantage of their age and knowledge to manipulate the impressionable minds of younger generations. |
| Tue | **Paragraph 1** **: On the one hand, it seems reasonable for the youth to be at liberty to make mistakes**  - Young individuals often make mistakes when they step out of their comfort zone and embark on new fields → young people are offered an opportunity to transcend our limitations insteading of remaining the same with complacency → Were it not for mistakes, youngsters might not have chance to realize their weaknesses and improve themselves from these  - Eg : Elon Musk and the electric car industry  **Paragraph 2** : Prevention from adults  - Adults have more experience → guide/orient young people who are immature and may make mistakes recklessly → if being allowed to freely make mistakes, youngsters may pay no heed to the consequences, → with their timely interference, adults can prevent the worse scenarios of young people being pulled in the vicious cycle of making mistakes with no lesson being learnt  **My opinion** : Guidance/orientation from adults rather than prevention is the most optimal. In that case, mistakes can provide valuable lessons, facilitating self-betterment | - The youth : immature → if being allowed to freely make mistakes, they may err in a reckless way and pay no heed to the potential consequences of their actions → In some worse scenarios, they may misperceive mistake making as a right that they always have, which can render the youth irresponsible citizens later in life.  - Adults may hinder the youth’s development with their prevention → Guidance and Orientation may not be rooted in expertise or experience → In that case, they might just overassert their role with manipulative action → This exclude the opportunity for the youth to improve themselves by learning mistakes |
| Hao | View 1: The prevention of the young from making mistakes can be justified for the following reasons   * Adults are more experienced and well-versed on matters regarding the law or future implications =>**Adults should intervene to preclude the younger generation from making mistakes that can have lasting harmful effects**   E.g: (Family context) Ensuring that they always do well on their exams as their grades will be in official records, affecting their future prospects.   * Furthermore, instil in young people a drive for perfection: youngsters are impressionable => teaching them to avoid mistakes early on can ensure that they always strive for perfection => A useful merit for adult life.   View 2: **Young people should have the right to make mistakes as these setbacks provide useful learning opportunities.**   * Contrary to popular beliefs, making mistakes allows the youth to improve: * They allow for better self-reflection on one’s weaknesses: Mistakes tell children where they need to improve on. * By allowing themselves to make mistakes, the young are encouraged to diligently deal with setbacks and have confidence in their abilities. * It demonstrates that parents are confident in their child’s abilities => children will be more willing to go out of their comfort zones and explore their aptitudes and talents.   E.g: “Albert Einstein failed the entrance exam to the Zurich Polytechnic School, but his parents did not lose faith in him, going so far as to help him avoid military service so that he could continue his studies.”  Opinion: Having discussed these two approaches to children making mistakes, I believe parents should be lenient and allow children to go out of their comfort zones. | Why young people should not freely make mistakes:   * Lasting consequences: Some consequences to mistakes are irreversibly deleterious and should be avoided at all cost.:   E.g: Dangerous sports such as cave diving can lead to life endangerment.   * **Can be harmful if young adults lack self-discipline**: * Without re-adjustments after each mistake, young people are prone to continue erring without improvement. * Instil a warped perception that they do not have to avoid mistakes   =>Neglect improvements because they are not afraid of mistakes  Why adults should not prevent the younger generation from making mistakes:   * Impinge on personal freedom => Reduced autonomy => Young people become dependent on outside intervention.=> Become passive/people-pleasers   E.g: helicopter parents tend to raise their children to be timid   * Young people would be unable to explore their talents and abilities: * Adults prevent mistakes => The youth become fearful of going out of the comfort zones => Risk-averse   E.g: (Work environment) Young people would hesitate to accept more responsibilities within a company as they lack initiative and confidence in their abilities. |
| Phúc | View 1: **On the one hand, youngsters should be granted the freedom to make mistakes on the grounds of their personal development.**   * Posterities learn the concept of actions and subsequent repercussion * Know to harness failures and mistakes which wil propel them to succeed. Ex: Not everyone is immaculate, evidenced by Eisten’s failure. * Children autonomy and freedom. Too mch parent interference can hamper children’s progress as they are bereft of goals and aspirations.   Ex: Undue emphasis placed on natural subjects or fields, such lawyer, doctor (jump on the bandwagon) → Seemingly rumernarative jobs → Turn out to be incredibly futile and hollow  Children are able to retrospect and evaluate their own potential because parental presence can dampen their progress.   * Too much protection from parens can culminate in a complacent, pusillanimous mindset for posterities   → Many kids present-day are not streetwise and devoid of basic life skills.  View 2: Adults should preemptively prevent thei**r young poeple from making mistakes**   * **P**arental guidance are more preferable as their wealth of experience and skills can be of great importance * Many can yet handle the consequence of their actions → deadly results (regarding water grave, traffics,). As youngsters are relative immature, they have a tendency to leverage their freedom for adverse cause, not for their personal development * Adults guidance is necessary to help youngsters to form a rational mind (--> learning to take calculated risks) * Senior people should protect their posterities from the ramifications of mistakes → Such responsiblity extend to the legal sphere, particularly for underages and juveniles   Opinion: A balance. | Why not?   * The relative immaturity of youngsters will rendered them vulnerable to the consequences of mistakes   Ex: Reckless driving and safety hazard.   * Young people have a proclivity to seek for atrocious activities (substance abuse, drinking and social ills) rather than actually capitalizing on such mistakes.   Why adults should not prevent   * Youngsters’ autonomy and freedom. Too much adult interference can hamper children’s progress as they are bereft of goals and aspirations.   Ex: Undue emphasis placed on natural subjects or fields, such lawyer, doctor (jump on the bandwagon) → Seemingly rumernarative jobs → Turn out to be incredibly futile and hollow  Youngsters are able to retrospect and evaluate their own potential because parental presence can dampen their progress.   * Too much protection from adults can culminate in a complacent, pusillanimous mindset for posterities   → Many kids present-day are not streetwise and devoid of basic life skills. |
| Vi | View 1: **Various reasons can be cited as to why youths should have the right to make mistakes**   * Freely making mistakes can be beneficial to youth's development -> gain resilience and self-confidence -> learn how to bounce back to solve issues -> More self-assurance when confronted with new obstacles. * Learning from errors helps youngsters develop a feeling of responsibility: they must bear the consequences of their actions and must be willing to change themselves rather than making excuses.   View 2: However, there are many justifications to the act of preventing mistakes by adults   * Parental action is necessary because of the long-term consequences on children -> Adults have more experience about the legal issues, long lasting after-effects. -> Better at handling these situations. Ex: Playing in the kitchen area * Adults are needed to prevent children from experiencing negative emotions -> Children are especially vulnerable -> Insecurities and low self-esteem   Opinion: Strike a balance between the two methods | Why children shouldn’t make mistakes:   * Freedom to make mistakes causes permanent damage.   Ex: sharp objects, electricity,...   * Decreased self-esteem and confidence if repeatedly done.   Why adults shouldn’t prevent children from making mistakes:   * The behaviour of adults can be overprotective and tend to over exaggerate the mistake -> The young cannot learn from anything resulting in no self-development -> Growing up sheltered may lead to the incapability of children to accomplish any task |

| Son | There is much discussion surrounding whether the youth should have autarky to err or that adults should preclude them from such activities. I will elucidate both sides of the argument and give my own opinion on the subject matter.  Body1: On the one hand, if young people are allowed leeway when making mistakes, they will be more incentivized to experiment with their undertakings, and therefore bolster their creative aptitude in such tasks. This also means a heightened ability for adaptivity, as their mindset is one suited to change and trial-and-error.  Setbacks also encourage independence and self-improvement. For example, mistakes in a test can be a motivator for students to improve themselves, making them better after erring. This leads to self-discipline and self-confidence, two highly important attributes in society.    In conclusion, although young people should have to an extent of freedom with regard to making mistakes, there needs to be adult intervention when dealing with this problem. I believe that by approaching this with a middle-of-the-road approach, the youth can fully realize their own potentials while not crossing the line by adults. | ok |
| Hao | Introduction: There is much debate on whether young people should have the right to make mistakes or the older generation should prevent them from doing so. I will elaborate on both sides to this argument before giving my opinion.  Conclusion: In brevity, while certain mistakes can lead to irreversible consequences, adults should not encroach too much on the autonomy of the youth to err as they stand to gain useful lessons from doing so. I believe adults should approach this matter pragmatically, insulating the inexperienced younger generation from deleterious mistakes and respecting their personal freedom to err and explore their abilities.  Body paragraph 1: On the one hand, having the right to make mistakes, the youth are more able to explore their personal aptitudes and talents. Setbacks provide invaluable learning opportunities as they allow youngsters to reflect on their weaknesses and devise plans for improvements. To illustrate, a bad grade can be a warning for students to focus more on that particular subject while also telling them what aspect of knowledge they did not study enough.Furthermore, if young people are not judged for their mistakes, they will be more willing to push their limits and challenge themselves with harder endeavours. |  |
| Bao | The issue of the young’s freedom to make mistakes is a widely debated one. Advocates for the young’s autonomy believe that their personal growth hinges on their freedom to err. While opponents of this belief emphasise the importance of adults’ intervention and guidance. In this essay, I will elaborate on both viewpoints and lay out my own opinion on this matter.  Advocates for autonomy often argue that the act of making mistakes is immensely important to the development of youth and should not be discouraged. To elaborate, facing setbacks provides the young with opportunities to reflect and learn from their mistakes as well as how to solve and avoid them in the future. Such first-hand experiences in problem-solving can become invaluable as they integrate into the real world. Moreover, prerogative to err also encourages creativity within the young as they would be more willing to challenge the convention and pave their own path, acting as the catalyst for new inventions and breakthroughs.  In conclusion, I believe that a middle ground for both perspectives would be the most beneficial for the young. Through granting them the freedom to err within a boundary of guidance, children can achieve personal growth while mitigating any severe consequences. | ok |
| Kiet | **Introduction:** There is a divergence of opinion on why youngsters should have the autonomy to err, whereas others believe that there should be intervention from experienced individuals. In this essay, I will analyse both sides of this argument and present my stance with pertinent illustrations to substantiate it.  **Body 1:** On the one hand, there exist various justifications why the youth should be given the liberty ito make mistakes. To commence with, the process of trial and error can help the youth develop resilience and problem-solving skills. In fact, these are among the most essential skills required to cope with the struggles and challenges of the real world. Moreover, allowing room for miscalculations can greatly enhance the creativity of younger generations. To explicate, young people are more inclined to experiment with novel ideas. Consequently, new discoveries and breakthroughs can be made due to their inquisitiveness and endeavour to challenge to status quo.  **Conclusion:** In conclusion, it is imperative to strike a balance between granting youths the liberty to blunder and the interference of adults. While young people can learn from their errors, adults can assist them in navigating potential pitfalls and offer advice based on their experience. Accordingly, I advocate the idea that suitable guidance from seasoned individuals can help the young generation to become resilient and responsible characters. | ok |
| Phuc | Mistakes are essential parts of everyone’s life. However, there emerge two schools of thought regarding the way people should approach errors in youngsters. While one dictate that autonomy in making errors should be exhorted, others argue that adults should protect youngsters from the ramifications of such mistakes. In this essay, i will elaborate on both views before justifying my opinion.  On the one hand, many justifications can be cited for the freedom to err in youngster’s life. To commence with, posterities can learn the concept of their action and the resulting consequence, thereby bolstering their understanding and ethical standards. Furthermore, this process is only optimized without the interference and viticuperration from adults which only serve to cramp their performance. Second, young people who can autonomously err are given the opportunity to explore themselves, finding their ultimate aspirations. To illuminate, the process of trial and errors involved means that youngster can evaluate their pitfalls, whereupon devising congruous countermeasures. Last, allowing posteries to err can facilitate their sense of perservance and resilience. As mistakes are essentially immanent and commonplace of youngster’s life, having at least some kind of foretaste and preliminary exposure to mistakes can represent a competitive advantage for blossoming youngsters. Furthermore, as these individuals are far more capable of harnessing the mistakes which will catapult them into success, thereby fine-tuning their progress. For example, for some children whose life are bristled with parental influences and guidance, they essetially do not possess the basic lifeskill and streetwise traits required to tackle the ramification of adult life.  In conclusion, while adults should have some authority over their younger counterparts’ approach to mistakes, autonomy to make mistakes plays a fundamental part in youngsters’ life. Such merits should yet be prescinded as well as mistakes innate demerits. Therefore, I think that a balanced approach to both standpoints should be favoured. |  |
| Linh Anh | Youngster’s right to commit mistakes has been the bone of contention among many individuals. While some people defend the new generation’s freedom to make errors, others argue by emphasizing the role of adults in restricting this prerogative. This essay will elaborate on both aspects of the argument and state my opinion on this matter.  On the one hand, there are a number of reasons that provide a rationale for youngsters’ freedom to make mistakes. Initially, it is undeniable that the right to make mistakes could help the young generations to freely develop perseverance without being judged. This is crucial since some young people bear the misconception that mistakes are unacceptable and they would be highly criticised upon making mistakes, causing them to constantly make an effort and avoid mistakes. Moreover, freedom to conduct errors allows for more valuable experiences for youngsters, for the development of the youth consists of the process of learning from mistakes. Therefore, more mistakes are fostered and cherished thanks to recognized right to err  In conclusion, although the right to make mistakes is well-justified for numerous benefits granted for young adults, it is desirable that the old generation’s intervention should be included to guarantee optimal advantages. Therefore, I support a balanced approach from both sides by both encouraging flaws and including adult’s control. |  |
| Lam | Opinions are divided on the younger generation’s right to err. Some individuals believe that the mistake-making of youngsters should be without discipline, while others think that seniors are supposed to intervene in such a phenomenon. In this essay, I will elucidate both of the aforementioned views, and expound on my own opinion regarding the matter.  Body 1: Myriad justifications can be cited to support the prerogative of the youth to make mistakes. Firstly, freely making mistakes can help develop responsibility in young adults as the consequences of their actions will directly affect them. In later years, this can turn into self-discipline, which is crucial in life and is much better attained sooner rather than later. Secondly, the right to err without judgement can be conducive to increasing adaptability to any given task, greatly benefiting problem-solving skills and critical thinking. Additionally, this also allows the youth to become more open-minded as they are not fettered by rules or regulations, so they can more deliberately discover new things and encounter the world around them. Despite that, some boundaries are not to be crossed to ensure that this does not backfire and cause detrimental effects to adolescents.  In conclusion, the reasons above explain the dispute about the prerogative of the youth to make mistakes.Personally, I advocate that an equilibrated approach be implemented, neither fettering adolescents nor acting indifferent towards their mischiefs. | Ok  Explain that freely making errors can bring about self-development in maturity and critical thinking for young adults, but certain measures should be used by elders to prevent them from going out of bounds. |
| Vi | **Introduction:** Some people condone the belief that adolescents should have the autonomy to make errors while others think adults should suppress it. This essay will elaborate on both viewpoints and present my opinion on the matter.  **Body 1:** On the one hand, freely making mistakes can be beneficial to youth's development. Through trial and error, people gain resilience and self-confidence. Once committing a mistake, adolescents will learn how to fix their wrongs, leading to their enthusiasm to bounce back and solve issues. This aids in their self-esteem in the sense that they understand that they do not have to be ashamed of their failures. Consequently, the young gain more self-assurance when confronted with new obstacles. Furthermore, learning from errors helps youngsters develop a feeling of responsibility. To elucidate, they must bear the consequences of their actions, resulting in the willingness to change themselves rather than creating excuses.  **Conclusion:** In conclusion, while the freedom to commit mistakes are key to the progression of youths, adult prevention can be beneficial to them in terms of their well-being. Despite their merits, I believe giving children the freedom to make errors is necessary. |  |
| Tue | Opinions diverge on the autonomy of young individuals to make mistakes. While some people contend that the youth should be at liberty to err, others uphold the prevention from adults. This essay will examine both given standpoints and their respective pertinence to my own opinion.  On the one hand, it seems reasonable for the youth to be free to make mistakes. Young people often err when they step out of their comfort zone and embark on new fields with trial and error. Were it not for mistakes, they may not have a chance to realise their weaknesses and improve themselves. As a result, when erring, the youth are offered an opportunity to transcend their limitations instead of remaining the same with complacency. This can be exemplified by various young innovators, namely Elon Musk. He was confronted with insurmountable challenges when investing heavily on the electric car industry. However, with each mistake being made on this journey, he came closer to the realisation of his electric car company by learning what he was missing and what he needed to improve. In brevity, the freedom to make mistakes can be conducive to youngsters’ self-development.  In conclusion, both sides of the argument have their own merits. However, I am wholeheartedly convinced that proper orientation rather than prevention from adults will be the most optimal approach to help the youth learn from their mistakes given the aforementioned reasons. That is why the older generation should take heed of their role in aiding the younger one in becoming responsible citizens. | ok |

| Linh Anh | Overview: all three surveyed food categories shared the same price in 1979 before witnessing an upward trend, with fresh fruits and vegetables seeing the most dramatic increase as opposed to sugar and sweets.  Paragraphing:  Paragraph 1: Fresh fruits and vegetable  surged and reached the peak of 325 in 2009, 4 times more than its starting point of only 75  Paragraph 2: Carbonated drinks and sugary food   * The cost of both types went up significantly and culminating at approximately 200 in 2009 * There was a small discrepancy between carbonated drinks and sweets with the former having higher cost.   Paragraph 3: Consumer-price index  Rising expenses of food sectors contributed to the growth of consumer-price index, evidenced by a double increase to 150 in 2009 | CPI  CPI |
| Kiet | Overall, all three surveyed food items saw an upward trend over the 30-year period, correlating with the ascending trend of consumer-price index. Moreover, fresh fruits and vegetables category experienced the most prominent growth.  Paragraph 1: Carbonated drinks and sugary food:  +Sugars and sweets and carbonated drinks experienced similar growth rates, increasing by roughly 200.  +Carbonated drinks were consistently more expensive over the timeframe.  Paragraph 2: Fresh fruits and vegetables:  +Fresh fruits and vegetables became the most costly category, with their price more than quintupled.  +At the end of the period, the quote of this group is less competitive compared to the two other products.  Paragraph 3: Consumer-price index  +The consumer price index also increased over the period from 50 to 150.  +It is also well-under all three mentioned groups. | ok |
| Vi | Overall, all food categories had an upward trend, in which fresh fruits and vegetables experienced the most significant increase. The figures of the consumer-price index correlated to that of the food items.  Paragraph 1: Fresh fruits and vegetables  - Had approximately 325 by 2009 despite its initial figure of 60 (5 times higher)  - Surged from 1989 to 2009  Paragraph 2: Sugar and sweets and carbonated drinks  - Undergone a similar trend throughout the timeline  - The discrepancy between the two items got more visible as time passed  Paragraph 3: Consumer price index  The three categories’ rise is evident in the progression of the consumer price index (More than doubled its initial figure) |  |
| Phuc |  |  |
| Lam | Overall, the price range across all categories had a similar starting point and experienced significant growth, **correlating with the notable rise of the CPI**. The most pronounced increase in cost belonged to fresh fruits and vegetables, as opposed to sugar and sweets.    Paragraph1: fresh fruits and vegetables were affordable in 1979, at just over 50-> almost 7 times as much 30 years later.  Paragraph 2: Sugar and sweets, along with carbonated drinks had identical prevalence in quotes (quadruples). Although the discrepancy between the two prices widened over time-> ended up at approximately the same price of 200 in 2009.  Para 3: CPI clearly depicts the gradual ascent of item cost (rose exponentially, evidenced by a gap of 100 concluding with 150) | perfect!  CPi integrated or ís mentioned first and used as a benchmark. |
| Bao | Overall, a gradual rise was observed in all categories within the first decade before diverging in 1989. The cost of fresh fruits and vegetables faced the most notable increase, contrasting carbonated drinks’ prices.  Paragraph 1: The price for fruits and vegetables witnessed many significant increments throughout the surveyed period:   * Nearly tripling within the first decade, from just above 50 to around 150 * Its price growth quickened from 1989 onwards, ending up at approximately 325 in 2009   Paragraph 2: +The cost of sugar and sweets, alongside carbonated drinks experienced similar marginal growth trends over the time frame.  +Their price gap widened over time but still ended up at around 200 nonetheless  Paragraph 3: All of the aforementioned increases in price across all items lead to a progressive rise in CPI, almost tripling by 2009 at 150, the lowest of the chart. | CPI? |
| Hao | Overview:   * Overall ascending trend in the prices of all surveyed commodities and the CPI * Increased at diverging rates after 1985.   Body:  Paragraph 1:   * From 1979-1985: all rose gradually to 100 * Sugar and carbonated drinks cost continued increasing at the same pace, quadrupling by 2009.   Paragraph 2:   * After 1985: The price of fresh fruits and vegetables started rising at an accelerated rate. * While the CPI slowly climbed to 150 in 2009, half the figure for fresh fruits and vegetables. |  |
| Tue | Overall : The surveyed categories all recorded the same starting point and an upward trend over the period shown, correlating with an increase in the consumer-price index. Additionally, while the most significant rise in price went to fresh fruits and vegetables, the opposite was true for sugar and sweets  Paragraphing :  - Fresh fruits and vegetables :   * 1979 : 50 * 2009 : the price increased 7 times, costing around 350   - “Carbonated drink” and “sugar and sweets” : similar degree of change   * Quadruple growth (50 → 200)   - Conclusion : price increases in all surveyed categories correlated with the triple rise in the consumer-price index | perfect! |
| Son | Overall: all three categories of food witnessed some types of increase in price from the same starting point in 1979 during the surveyed period of time, with fresh fruits and vegetables undergoing the most prominent development as opposed to carbonated drink as well as sugar and sweet’s gradual rise.  Paragraphing: dree of change (most radical to most minuscule)  Par1 (fresh fruits and vegetables):  --- saw a massive plunge in price in 1984 to 80  --- followed by a sporadic insurgence for the next 25 years, reaching an all-time peak of 330 in 2008, more than quintupling the figure in 1979  Par2 (sugar and sweets/ carbonated drinks):  --- upon closer inspection, can be seen a near-identical growth pattern between 1979 to 1989  --- following 1989, carbonated drinks surpassed and remained the second highest in price over the timeframe  --- culminating in roughly 220 for carbonated drinks, and 200 for sugar and sweets  Par3 (CPI: customer-price index)  --- portrayed a consistent growth over 30 years, doubling from 70 to 160  --- albeit slower than the three aforementioned food categories | CPI |

Brainstorming and Idea development

| Name | Why do people play sports? 4pm | Why some people cannot play sports …4h10 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Tue | - Physical health : Preventing a sedentary lifestyle  - Recreation and leisure (mental health) : recharge one’s batteries → release negative feelings → mood enhancement  - Innate interests/preferences : the desire to take part in physical activities | - Extrinsic/external reason :   * Social constraints :   excessive time for working/studying …  - Intrinsic reason :   * Not physically/mentally fit enough * Disabilities |
| Vi | Because of its many advantages:  - Strengthens the mind and body  - Relaxation, reduces stress  - Energises ourselves  - Improves sleep and health  - Allows us to socialise with those who have similar interests  - Develop some skills | - Time (too busy…)  - Unmotivated to play  - Doesn’t have anyone to teach or play with  - Incapability (Disability…) |
| Phuc | Physical well-beings and therapeutic benefits   * Dwarf aging * Foster circulation, digestion and immune system * Ex: Sedentary people vs active   Innate flair.   * A fundamental part of schools’ curriculum * Ex: A prevalent affinity for soccer…..   Professional career:  → as well as recreational purpose and socializing affair  Ex: Bolster one’s social sphere due to similar interests → Improve techniques and expertise in a certain field. | * Physical incapicitations and syndromes. * Mental disorders * Hectic and jam-packed shedules, itinerary * No means to engage in expensive sports * Introvert traits |
| Lam | Physical and mental benefits  -physical:   * Get fit and stronger * Proven to improve longevity,esp racket sports by up to 9 years.   Mental:   * Regarded as a form of entertainment * Doing sports releases dopamine and other endorphins which help improve mood.   - career prospects:   * Can go pro and compete for fame and riches, passionate and compulsive. | -Intrinsic and extrinsic causes  Intrinsic:   * Socially awkward, social anxiety-> cannot interact with other and so unable to engage in sports(introvert) * Is lazy, passive, does not like going outside. * Physical disabilities that inhibits the ability to move around and do sports   Extrinsic:   * Does not have local facilities to play certain sports, ex: soccer fields, tennis courts…. * Unable to afford equipments: some sport gear is costly and reserved for those well-off, good quality badminton rackets can range up to 5 million vnd per racket * Some sports are too dangerous , hesitant from trying. |
| Linh Anh | * Physical benefits   +Improve our health  +Strengthen our stamina  => reduce the risk of diseases   * Mental benefits   + A good form of entertainment => relieve stress, bring about joy  + Provide sense of well-being and boost confidence   * Benefits one’s personal life by   + Cultivate personality: perseverance and endurance  + Improve teamwork skills => beneficial in working | Extrinsic factors   * Physical deformity: disabled ones * In-born health problems that prevent people from participating in sports * No access to adequate sport infrastructure * Lack of time allocated for sport activities   Intrinsic factors   * The state of idleness, unwilling to exercise * Lack of self-confidence |
| Kiet | There exist numerous reasons why people play sports:   1. Physically:  * Improve overall health. * Increase life expectancy. * Help manage weight.  1. Mentally:  * Promote self-esteem and confidence. * A healthy environment to cooperate and make relationships -> enhance overall mental well-being  1. Miscellaneous:  * Some do sports professionally (their occupation) * Hobbies.. | * Existing diseases that can obstruct performance: asthma, pneumonia, etc * Physical deformity: lack of confidence and essential body parts to engage in sports. * Sports demand high stamina and endurance, most people cannot meet those prerequisites. * Sports are time-consuming -> people with strict schedules can hardly allocate adequate time. |
| Son | 1. Physical:  * Maintain a healthy, toned physique as well as a heightened immune system (less fat) * Using muscle fibres regularly preclude them from atrophy or deterioration * Help reduce some types of diseases * Hone one’s reflexes, hand-eye coordination and strength  1. Mental:  * Sports usually involve other people, so practising can improve socialising skills * Can be therapeutic, as sports participation reduces stress and anxiety (idk about this one) * Teamwork | 1. Physical:  * Disabilities * Diseases * Some extreme sports are unsuitable for some types of people (physically insufficient) * Lack adequate equipments  1. Mental  * Lack encouragements * Social anxiety  1. Others  * No friends (literally me) * No time (busy schedule, incapable of allocating time) |
| Bao | They bring about many benefits:   * Physically: * Stay fit, healthy * Reduce risk of many diseases * Ensure longevity * Mentally: * Help reduce stress * Improve self-confidence * Drastically reduce mental illnesses (depression, anxiety)   Sports are also good ways to socialize and meet new people  Sports can encourage the development of interpersonal skills:   * Leadership skills (Football, volleybal) * Better teamwork and communication   In modern days, sports can be full time careers. | Lack of engagement in sports can stem from medical problems:   * Physical disabilities * Conditions that prevent heavy exercises (Asthma, heart disease )   Personality can also affect one’s willingness in partaking sports:   * Being introverted or socially anxious (afraid of being judged by others) * Lack of motivation   The prevailing notion that certain sports are only meant for certain people ( Ex: Basketball requires a certain height)  Extrinsic causes:   * lack of free time (due to work/school) * Discouragement from peers or family members |
| Hao | Physical benefits:   * Better health: * Improve physical resilience and energy level   E.g: Cardio helps increase body resilience and reduce the risk of heart disease   * Better sleep: Limit time on digital devices, the body gets tired naturally, allowing for easier sleep.   Mental benefits:   * Cope with stress: * Exercising produces “feel-good” chemicals such as adrenaline. * Helps people forget about everyday problems. * Better physique from exercising can improve self-confidence. * E.g:   Six-pack  Increased sweating => clear out face pores => Clearer facial skin | Time constraints:   * Long work/school hours => cannot set aside time for sports   Physical impediments:   * Congenital diseases:   E.g: heart disease => cannot withstand heavy lifting/cardio  Bad eye-sight => Cannot participate in shooting sports.  Lack of proper equipment:   * School/Area does not have the necessary equipments to play certain sports:   E.g: No open field to play soccer. |

| Thom - health | -Health booster: endurance, muscles, fitness, immunity  -Stress anti-depression; happiness hormones (endorphin)  -Community health improvement | -wounds/ accidents/ incidents/ life threatening  -syndrom: withdrawal / deformation / stress  -bizarre / abnormality |  |
| Kiet - employment | -Create numerous job opportunities, ex:   * Sports retail: shoes, jerseys, etc. * Domestic leagues and regional leagues: players, staffs, referees, etc.   -It is a popular and consistent industry around the world -> always a demand for talents and personnel -> generate immense income -> great industry to work in.  -Does not require substantial certificates to become an athlete -> create more chances for the disadvantaged. | - High risks and highly-demanding -> most do not land a professional contract as an athlete.  -Short career span -> most sports require good physique and stamina -> aging process can heavily affect sportspeople. Ex: Jack Wilshere, a professional English footballer retired at 30.  -Pressure to perform from fans and the media -> negatively impact one’s mental stability -> diminishing the satisfaction and joy sports are supposed to bring.  -Most sports are seasonally based. Ex: Champions League, Serie A, etc only runs for a specific period of time every year. -> job instability and inconsistent employment. |  |
| Tue - politics | - Enhance nationalism:  + Ex: Citizens of the same country support for the national team → foster a sense of national identity → enhance patriotism  + Eg: World Cup ( national team succeeds → national pride )  - Diplomatic relations :  + Ex: international competitions → involve many nations → opportunity to form relations  + Eg: Olympics | - Extreme/aggressive nationalism :  + Ex: aggressive support → a sense of hate towards opponents → abusive remarks  + Eg: impolite/aggressive Vietnamese football fans in Asean  - Boycott in relations :  + Ex : Refuse the entry of some nations which are politically aggressive  + Eg : Olympics boycotted Russia |  |
| Vi - social issues | - Awareness of mental issues: Professionals could express their struggles to the public with wide media coverage.  - Equal pay regardless of gender | - Gender inequality: Before, some sports banned the participation of women. Ex: The Olympics didn’t allow women to run in marathons.  - Gender identity: Men participating in “feminine sports” were laughed upon. - Wealth inequality |  |
| Phuc - education | Facilitate academic performace and the equilibrium between studying and recreation  Ex: Sports foster neurological development, whereupon generating positive temperaments which is of good value for studying.  Instill a sense of camaraderie and rapport between students → Colloboration and peer learning  Instil the value of sports, self-care from an early age for students. | Estraneous natures → Insignficant and have no bearings to children’s lives.  For example: The sheer workload of students present-day, PE does not present any palpable value  Undue emphasis placed on sports can inhibit academic progress  Ex: Children, under the pretext of playing shorts, overlook their studying.  Safety concerns and health hazards.  No accoutrements and reliable platforms, facilities  Understaffed and legal implications |  |
| Bao - environment | -Certain sports promote environmentally friendly means of transports  Ex: cycling to work  -> reduces the amount of cars on the road  - Special sporting events (notably marathons) can be part of a campaign to promote eco-friendliness | -The construction and maintenance of sports facilities is releasing many pollutants into the atmosphere, especially big stadiums  -Major sports competitions can incite many types of pollution (from travelling and littering)  -Sports such as hunting are still prevalent in many places and can further endanger certain types of animal |  |
| Hao - tourism | - Attract more visitors to the host country of sports events: E.g: The Tokyo Olympics helped Japan attract media attention and tourists.  - Foster better relationships between countries=>indirectly encourage tourism between countries | * Large sports events disrupt tourism: causing traffic congestion, erratic behaviour of sport fanatics disturbs tourists. * Superficial economic benefits discourage visitors: Governments build new infrastructure to host sports events but do not maintain them.   E.g: New roads and wall decorations were forgotten by the Brazilian government after the 2016 Olympics ended => Unsightly view for visitors. |  |
| Son - culture | - Sports and culture are interdependent - sports is intertwined in almost every facet of culture  - example: sports like football is popular in vietnam, and is commonly used as a rallying tool where people can find a common ground  - fostering communal traits such as teamwork, fair play and discipline (idk about this one tbh) | - Patriotism in sports can lead to extreme fanaticism  - Cultural taboos (doping, corruption, sexual abuse often thrives in major sports)  - foreign sports can inadvertently be detrimental to the existing cultures |  |
| Linh Anh - legal issues | Positive: reduce crime rate  + By enhancing social relationships and well-being -> sports can be a protective factor against criminal development  Ex: In jails, prisoners are allowed to participate in sports activities -> further enhance their sense of well being.  + Provide civil lessons and social role models through coaching | Negative:  Increase rates of illegal betting and gamble  + More sport events => bets emerged in an exponential degree with lavish prizes  => come along with debts which debtors are unable to afford => growth of suicide  - Some countries employ death sentences for the losing teams in the competition of sports  Ex: North Korea  - Drug abuse to buff muscles and stamina |  |
| Lam - economy | The sports industry is a  major component of global economy-constituted to over 400 million US dollars in 2022  Sports competition is a major playground for big brands to advertise their products, explanation : brands sponsor players-> gain publicity->encourage buyers to purchase products-> help boost the economy. | -subsidies to build facility can abates economic growth of a local area: cost huge funds which could be put into other necessities which are more crucial |  |

**Sample**

*(image removed)*

Depicted in the line chart are how many computers each U.S citizen possessed throughout 15 years commencing in 1997. The triennial statistics are gauged in percentage terms of the total population.

Initial inspection reveals the overall ascending trend in computer ownership in the U.S., **regardless of quantities**, correlating with the decrease in no-computer ownership. Also noteworthy is that the majority of the population owned at least one device.

A declining pattern was observed in the number of people in the U.S. possessing no computer. In 1997, there were seven out of ten people without possession of the device. However, the figure had consistently slid away till the end; one-fifth of the population had not had any item by 2012.

By stark contrast, there had been a significant growth in the U.S. computer ownership. The most pronounced was the data of one-item owners, whose remarkable increase indicated half of the population in 2009 from the initial 28%. The figure for those with multiple computers also witnessed an ascent, yet not significant enough to reflect overall universality. Merely 5% of the population had two computers in 1997, while almost no individual was recorded with up to three devices. From 2000 to 2009, both categories shared identical increasing trends, at 30% on aggregate. Nonetheless, while more and more people possessed two computers in the last interval, with approximately 22%, the figure for over 3-computer owners slightly decreased to under 10%.

Para 1:( No change) Sydney(highest) and Melbourne: regardless of water usage - Sydney 2nd - Melbourne: least **253**

Para 2: Brisbane (second highest): a gap of 3 cents -> second lowest

Para 3: Perth and Adelaide: a record low of **0.42** -> 1.50 and 1.00 => Perth: most costly : **332**

Conclusion (optional): Average bills tend to depend more on usage change over 125 KL, evidenced by similar rankings recorded in these two indicators.

**Sample**

Demonstrated is the table about the water prices for two divergent levels of consumption, up to and above 125KL in five Australian cities.

By and large, Perth residents shell for the highest household water bills, as opposed to Melbourne. Additionally, the average bill tends to depend more on usage change over 125 KL.

Upon closer inspection, no price discrepancy is observed in the usage changes in Sydney and Melbourne, at 0.98 and 0.71 respectively. Being in the top three for both categories, Sydney culminates to the second highest overall water cost at 319 dollars. By contrast, after 125KL, the same rate in Melbourne turns out to be the most competitive, correlating to the lowest level of 253 dollars in the average bill.

Meanwhile, there is a subtle increase of 3 cents from the second highest price of 0.81 dollars in Brisbane. Nevertheless, the price of water after the benchmark becomes the second lowest, making the average cost drop to a similar position, with 310 dollars.

Regarding the remaining cities, Perth and Adelaide have water prices for the first index in common, with the most affordable quote of 0.42 dollars, followed by a correspondingly triple and double increase to the highest levels post 125KL. Accordingly, these two enter the top three cities whose inhabitants need to cover the heftiest water bills, evidenced by a record high of 332 dollars in Perth.

| Tue | The given table compares five Australian cities in terms of the water prices and the median expenditure per household.  On the whole, it is noticeable that all surveyed areas underwent an increase in the cost of a kiloliter of water when the usage exceeds 125KL, **except for Melbourne and Sydney.** It can also be seen that the most notable rise in price went to Perth which also had the highest average spending per household.  A closer inspection of the table indicates a similar pattern between Adelaide and Perth which have the same price for a kililiter of water (up to 125KL) at $0.42. Additionally, these two cities also had the most significant growth in water prices with over 125KL of usage, with a threefold one for Perth and a twofold one for Adelaide. **As a result, Perth and Adelaide respectively ranked first and third regarding the average bill, at $332 and $310.**  By contrast, while Brisbane only saw a marginal rise in cost from $0.81 to $0.84 when the usage surpasses 125KL, its the median spending was almost as high as that of Adelaide.    As for the remaining regions, **both Melbourne and Sydney recorded no additional charge for over 125KL of water, charging a respective price of $0.78 and $0.98 per kiloliter.** However, while the median bill per household of Melbourne was significantly lower than that of other cities at $253, that of Sydney ranked second in the table at 319$.

| Hao | The table compares water prices in five different Australian cities.  Overall, all cities besides Perth have cost increases per kiloliter of 1 dollar or less. Additionally, Perth has the highest average household water bill.  Melbourne and Sydney are the only 2 cities whose water prices are consistent regardless of the number of kiloliters used, at 0.78 dollars and 0.98 dollars respectively. Furthermore, Melbourne has the lowest average household bill at 253 dollars while the figure for Perth is the highest, at 332 dollars.  Although Perth and Adelaide have the highest water prices after 125 kiloliters used at 1 dollar and 1.50 dollar respectively, their prices are the cheapest below 125 kiloliters of usage, at 0.42 dollars. Brisbane’s water price only increases 3 cents from 0.81 dollars after 125 kiloliters.

| Vi | The given table compares the water prices and average water bill per household in five metropolitan areas in Australia.  Overall, there is a rise in water cost in most cities after consuming over 125 Kl, notably in Adelaide and Perth. Moreover, all households residing in these areas possess a similar average water bill.  Adelaide’s water price for water consumption under 125kl is the same amount as Perth’s. These two cities are also the only to witness an upsurge in pricing for over 125kl of use, each amounting to $1.00 and $1.50. For under 125kl of water usage, Brisbane charges $0.81/kl and charges an additional $0.03 per kiloliter once over the threshold. The average bill per house in Adelaide and Brisbane are similar, at $310, while Perth is $20 higher.  Melbourne’s and Sydney’s cost remains the same regardless of the water quantity, having $0.78 and $0.98 respectively. The average bill for Melbourne is at its lowest of $253, which is $66 less than Sydney’s figure.  (162 words) | - Benchmark mentioned (Overview)  - No correlation  - City based |
| Lam | The table compares water prices in 5 distinct cities in Australia and presents changes in pricing when water usage exceeds 125 kiloliters.  Overall, every city witnesses a rise in cost once beyond the 125Kl mark, bar Melbourne and Sydney, with the former having the record low median bill per home.  An analysis r**eveals that there is no increase in water cost in Melbourne or Sydney regardless of consumption, evidenced by Sydney unchanging $0.98 charge, gaping Melbourne by $0.20.** These are also the highest prices for water below 125kl use.  For Adelaide and Perth, they were the most economical for under 125kl consumption at $0.42/kl; however, their pricing skyrockets upon further usage.Perth claims the all-time high of $1.50/kl, and Adelaide is only behind by $0.50. Most noticeably, Brisbane witnessed the most marginal prevalence in pricing, established by a difference of $0.03.  As for the average bill in each destination, Perth had the highest at $332, followed by Sydney with a discrepancy of 13. Adelaide and Brisbane have similar household checks of around $310, being $57 over that of Melbourne. (187 words) | Yes benchmark(both intro and overview) should only be once.

| Phuc | The given table delineated the charging schemes for water and average expenditure for water per household across Australia.  Overall, cost of water in Adelaide and Perth is distinctively low but surpassing the 125-KL threshold saw an exponential surge in price. Contrariwise, the price tag for water in the three remaining metropolises has little or no quota imposed upon.  When consumption in aggregation is below 125 kiloliter, cost of water registers at 0,42$ in Adelaide, Melbourne. However, a two-fold increase in price is applied in Adelaide passing the 125-KL threshold. The equivalent figure in Perth reaches a record high of 1,5% per kiloliters, hence the highest average expenditure for water in this city with 332$.  Apropos of Brisbane and Melbourne, the price tag of water stands at 0,78 and 0.81 respectively while people in Sydney pays nearly one dollar for water. Noticeably, people in Sydney and Melbourne are not prerequisites to pay additional fee for water consumptions. Similarly, a mere 0,03 rise in price is applied in Sydney if total usage surpasses 125 KL. Consequentially, average expenditure for water is lowest in Melbourne with 250$ on average while households in Aladaile, Brisbane and Sydney pay around 310$ for water. 203 words | Introduction: No benchmark  Overview: Mentioned  No correlation mentioned  Body 1: Changes between column 1 and 2  Body 2: No changes between the two column |
| Bao | The table depicts water prices as well as the average expenditure of households in five Australian cities.  Overall, the majority of cities witness a rise in cost when water usage exceeds the 125 kiloliters mark, except for that of Sydney and Melbourne.  Among the five cities, only **Sydney and Melbourne have consistent cost per kiloliter even beyond the 125Kl mark, at $0.98 and $0.78 respectively**. Moreover, the latter have the lowest figure for average expenditure per household at $253  Perth’s and Adelaide’s number for water price, despite ranking the lowest under 125 Kl at $0.42, meet a notable climb up to $1.50 and $1.00 respectively after exceeding the 125Kl point, constituting first and second place. The former also tops the chart in terms of median expenditure at $332.  Brisbane’s figure also faced a rise when reaching the 125Kl ma**rk but to a less significant degree**. Furthermore, its average water bill adds up to $310, placing it in fourth place.

| Son | The provided table elucidates the water expenses of 5 different cities in Australia based on the quantity used.  Overall, aside from Melbourne and Sydney, most cities experience a rise in cost after using more than 125kl of water, especially Perth and Adelaide. Perth also holds the highest average water cost per household, as well as the highest cost when water use is above the threshold.  **Consumption of more than 125kl of water does not increment the cost per kiloliter for Melbourne and Sydney, with both cities having a fixed cost of $0.78 and $0.98 respectively**, ostensibly leading to the former’s position as having the lowest average water bill per household. Whereas Brisbane, while only needing to pay $0.03 when water use exceeds the threshold, has to spend $57 more on average.  On the other hand, Adelaide and Perth, while both having the lowest cost in terms of water usage less than 125kl, surge in cost above the threshold, more than doubling for the former and almost quadrupling for the latter.

| Linh Anh | The given table depicts the water expenses for 5 different cities in Australia based on the used amount of water.  Overall, most cities witness a rise in water expenses when passing 125kl except for Melbourne and Sydney whose figures remain stable. Additionally, Melbourne pays the lowest for water per household while an average household in Perth spends the highest on water usage. (gooooood)  **It both costs $0.42 per 1 kilolitre of water in Adelaide and Perth when up to 125 kilolitre is consumed**. However, when the water consumption exceeds 125 kilolitre, Adelaide's data doubles to $1.00 while that of Perth triples to $1.50, making it the most exorbitant among the 5 countries. Similarly, there is a slight increase of $0.03 in the water charges per kilolitre in Brisbane upon passing 125 kilolitre. Meanwhile, Melbourne and Sydney retain the same prices for both under 125 kl and over 125 kl water utilised (for both levels), with 0.78$ and 0.98$ respectively.  With Perth charging the highest in water bills when surpassing the 125 kl mark, each family there spends the biggest number of $332, which is roughly $80 more than Melbourne with only $253 poured into water consumption per household.

| Kiet | The table demonstrates the expenditure on water of five different urban areas in Australia.  Overall, there is an increase in the majority of water cost **upon reaching** 125 KI in the surveyed regions, except for Melbourne and Sydney whose figures remain static. Moreover, Perth has witnessed the most remarkable expansion and outstanding average costs.  A closer inspection of the table indicates that Melbourne and Sydney have a similar pattern. Both cities maintained a constant rate of $0.78 per kiloliter and $0.98 per kiloliter, respectively. Regarding Adelaide and Perth, in spite of the equal initial expenses, Perth's cost surge is 50% greater than that of Adelaide after exceeding 125 KI. Besides, Perth registers the peak average water consumption payment of $332.  As for Brisbane, it is the area with the least change in water cost, commencing at $0.81 per kiloliter, with a marginal 3 cents addition when transcending the 125 KI threshold. Furthermore, it records the second-lowest water cost, being $22 lower than that of Perth.  (163 words) | -Benchmark mentioned (overview)  -No correlation?  -City-based |

| Phuc | The given excerpt illustrates the merits of tram compared **to other transportational platforms** and its (their) pitfalls. Tram systems, just like railways, manifest a propitious solution for traffic tailbacks, but more time intensive. Robert Clayton had reportedly considered halting the proliferation of tram systems due to their space-intensive quiddities and inconvenience induced on commuters. Additionally, trams are more **boisterous** as opposed to buses while being deemed implausible in narrow settings. However, the author suggests the widespread construction of tram systems as they are electric-based, hence culminating in little pollution as well as being less costly. Another redeeming feature of tram is that customer comfort is **vouchsafed**, confirmed by Clayton.105 words | Title  No titles.  Yet time-consuming  timetable??? |
| -Vi | The extract elaborates the advantages and disadvantages of using trams as a solution to traffic jams. To commence with the benefits, the tram is environmentally-friendly since it runs on electricity. Furthermore, they are more economical to construct in comparison to railway tracks. However, Robert Clayton mentions that because the tram requires much space, road problems are created, causing inconvenience to the commuters. Another issue is that trams use a fixed route to operate; therefore, it cannot change flexibly as opposed to buses. Nevertheless, although trams are considerably noisier than buses, the author supports the use of trams due to the fact that they are comfortable.  (106 words) | - No title  - Outstanding features compared to other means  - Regarding the benefits  - Compared to  They  Albeit noisier, trams are favoured due to passengers’ comfort, confirms Clayton. |
| Lam | The author suggests building tram systems to address traffic jams and lists the reasons to install one in cities around the world, as well as names its flaws. The writer states that trams are environmentally-friendly as they rely on electricity for fuel. Trams are also more cost effective than railways, though both are needed in most residential areas. Lastly, trams provide fixed routes and are ultimately more comfortable for commuters, albeit noisier than buses *said Robert Clayton*. Some drawbacks of trams include the time-consuming aspect of erecting a system, followed by the lack of room in many narrow streets.

| Son | The extract elucidates the implications of (constructing a ) tram system to combat increasing traffic jams. Apropos of the advantages, trams have little contribution to environmental damage and climate change due to an electric-run system. Other benefits in utilising trams include a cheaper cost for track construction, a fixed routes and generally more comfortable than buses to commuters. However, as confirmed by Robert Clayton, a transport expert, trams necessitate a wide road to operate in, which hinders its ability to be used in cities with narrow streets. Another negative mentioned by the expert is the fact that trams generally produce more noise than buses. Nevertheless, the author still advocates using them.

| Tue | The extract elucidates the pros and cons of the tram system which is a potential solution to urban traffic congestion. Concerning the benefits; firstly, as trams are electricity-based, they are more eco-friendly. Secondly, tram systems are more cost-effective than railway lines. Thirdly, by having an unchanged location, tram tracks are more accessible than buses. The final merit is the comfort offered by trams. Regarding the disadvantages; the first one is the time-consuming construction of a tram system. Additionally, trams need a large space to operate, as stated by a transport expert Robert Clayton. The final demerit is excessive noise created by trams, as opposed to buses. (106 words) | No title  How the merits of  Former  routes/ timetable  However, their drawbacks include …  Also notable is |
| Linh Anh | The given passage provides reasons to construct a tram system as well as including some demerits of tram. Firstly, trams are considered an environmentally-friendly transportation since they operate on electricity. Secondly, trams are also favorable thanks to their economical building cost compared to that of railways. Moreover, trams run on a fixed route, offering greater convenience for commuters(which is more convenient for passengers) despite its excessive noises. Nevertheless, the function of trams is hindered by lack of space in cities. The author justifies this point by stating a historical reference of tram system in Melbourne made by Robert Clayton and comparing it to cities with limited space.

| Bao | The extract depicts the merits and demerits of constructing a tram system within a city. **Firstly, trams are favoured for being environmentally friendly as they operate on electricity, producing minimal pollution**. Furthermore, they are more economical to build than that of railways. Trams are also preferred for their fixed route and comfortability despite being quite noisy compared to buses. However, trams pose a major issue within some cities as they require open and wide spaces to not impede traffic flows. The author then referenced a transport expert, Robert Clayton, to exemplify this point.Moreover, trams are considerably noisier compared to buses. Despite its issues, the author still advocates for the utilisation of trams in cities. (115 words) | * No title * Compare it to other means * Justify the merits , overweighting the demerits |
| Kiet | The extract elucidates the author’s reasons for constructing tram systems to address urban traffic congestions alongside its benefits and drawbacks. The first merit is that trams are environmentally friendly as they are powered by electricity. Moreover, tram tracks are more cost-effective compared to their railway counterparts, though most professionals suggest that metropolitan areas require both. Additionally, trams provide **static** routes and comfortability for their passengers, despite being noisier than buses. However, there exist some notable disadvantages, namely the prodigious time needed to establish a system, as well as the limited vacancy in certain areas with narrow streets.(97 words) | -No title  Grounded on their features  Coupled with … |
| Hao | The excerpt compares the merits and demerits of tram systems to other public transportation. It takes considerable time to construct a tram system. However, trams operating on electricity cause minimal pollution, and tram tracks are significantly more economical to build compared to railway lines. Another major issue with implementing trams is that it requires enough road space for other vehicles to drive around them, as explained by transport expert Robert Clayton. Trams are also significantly noisier than buses. Nevertheless, Robert explains that tram routes are fixed, and trams are more comfortable for passengers, which are important benefits to consider.

| **Bao (1)-(2)** | Many things about myself have changed ever since I got into highschool, both physically and mentally. Physically, **my height h**asn’t changed much but I have gained a considerable **amount of weight**. But the most significant changes occured in my mentality. I feel that I am **much less naive than I was before.** Entering highschool has exposed me to the many facets of life that I was not fully aware of before, such as the depth and complexity of relationships, society and life as a whole. I have made new friends and rivals, been through good and bad times, encountered many challenges along the way. All of this have *helped widen my perspective of the world*, reminding me that there are many who are more talented than myself.

| **Phuc 3 -4** | The time span of two years has inevitably induced many transformative changes for me, particularly in the sense of two year of high schools. One of the most epoch-making happenings occurred in this period was my matriculation into Nguyen Du gifted schools, thus moving into Buon Ma Thuot City. Here, i have got first-hand experience of metropolitician lifestyles and deviation from the protective blossom of supportive families. Hence, i witnessed many unforseeable ramifications of autonomous lives as well as the demerits of metropolises including social ills, traffic snarl-ups, rampant polution. However, it must be attested that I do enjoy the therapuetic experience that city offers, hence colosally bostering my social circle and sphere of influence. Here, i got to fully express my idosyncrasies and personality traits. Academic-wise, enrollment in a highly prestigious gift schools, particularly a class purpose-built for adept English speakers is parallel to the nonpareil opportunity to *encounter great individuals who share an innate affinity for English*. Furthermore, I was provided with the accoutrements and pedagogical instructions needed for English proficiency, hence my *participation in the local NEC Team*. All in all, my recent 2 years residing in high schools has seen many metamorphosing changes for me, from a *wide-eyed youngster to a streetwise, clear-minded, all-round individual.* Therefore, I emancipated my vision for the last year in high school with gratification and an erudite sense to fully develop myself. Furthermore, I would aspire to foster my English skills across provinces, speaking, reading, writing and listening. | Changes in lifestyles and academic progress.

| **Vi (5) - (2)** | At a glance, I may seem to have not changed at all compared to when I was a freshman in high school. However, deep within I know that one thing has changed, **my swimming abilities**. Due to the fact that I have not been attending my school’s training sessions, I feel like my skills have deteriorated. Before, accumulating a total of ten medals, I would be the subject of envy for my swimming speed. Now, *I can no longer float above the water and will constantly continue to swallow chlorine once in it.* It feels crappy to be unable to enjoy the waves whenever my family goes to the beach, definitely more so every time I see my sister swimming effortlessly.

| **Son (impromptu), 5-1** | Two years, between secondary and high school, is probably one of my most significant years up to date, not least since I moved to BMT city. **Making new friends, adapting to the bustling lifestyle of the urban experience and learning who I really aspire to be were some of the defining features of this time.** Ever since I studied here, I was able to **r*ealise the extent to which I was missing out on English***. , There are an abundance of people that are better than me that I have to overcome and to this day I still strive to be able to usurp them. Relating to this, the resources and pedagogical knowledge are now more than ever, English or otherwise. With them, **I was able to expedite my learning and achieve a level of enlightenment, albeit a small one.** With this in mind, however, my mindset has largely **remained the same** throughout. I am still a hot-headed, heedless optimist who tries to usurp his own expectations about himself and everyone else. I **still go to great lengths** to be better than anyone else, notwithstanding the mental or physical sacrifices I have to take.

I used to be scared of failure and setbacks and always doubting myself, now, I view them as an *incentive for me to thrive*. I also have a much *more positive outlook on life* after facing numerous challenges during my last two years. I believe that this is a beneficial change for myself compared to the anti-social and frigid person I used to be and now *capable of setting my own goals undeterred by the fear of failure*. I do know that there are plenty of people who are more outstanding than me out there, so it is best to set my own goal to a practicable degree, knowing that excelling truly proficient individuals would be virtually impossible. | -Not topic front(mentality and personality)  - Reason: personality change ->Intrinsic  -Impact: positive outlook and unfazed mindset |
| **Hao (cách 2: degree of change) 2** | There are major differences between my current self and the person I was three years ago. Regarding appearance, I am significantly **leaner** now compared to when I first matriculated at my current highschool. Other than that, my appearance has largely stayed the same. Meanwhile, my personality and thinking-process have gone through a transformation. I am more **mature**, and I have cultivated **a higher stress tolerance**, *able to cope with academic pressure more easily*. Moreover, **my planning skills have got significantly better**. This has allowed *me to discover my passion and goals in life such as what I want to learn at University and what kind of job I want when I grow up.* Accompanied by my newfound self-awareness is **a change in personality**. I am **less gregarious at school now, and dedicate more time to my family.** Overall, my appearance did not change much after 3 years, but I am a significantly more mature person mentality-wise. | * Topic front * Physical and mindset * No reason mentioned * No consideration mentioned |
| **Linh Anh**  **(1-patterns) << 1 or 3** | For self-reflection, I would say I have gone through significant changes during the past 3 years. The most notable change is that I have grown to **become more mature and responsible** for my decisions in life. 3 years ago, I must admit that I always hesitated whenever faced with tough decisions and I was wary of making unbearable mistakes.I felt like I lacked the confidence needed in class; therefore, I passed up on the opportunities to develop myself. As I entered high school, I have stumbled upon much hurdles, thanks to which I learn to place more confidence in myself. I turn into *a more outgoing and sociable girl* *and more open to new relationships* as I met so many friendly people. I suppose it is fine to say that I have the right to be proud of myself for what I have achieved so far. However, I still have room for improvement, which is why I will never stop ameliorating myself. | Not topic front  Personal growth  Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation  Relationship aspects |
| **Tue (1-1)** | **The most noticeable difference is that I am now more mature in various aspects than I was one year ago**. *Academically,* I have acquired a deeper understanding of various subjects, especially in English. This, as a result, can better equip me to pursue my higher education. *Socially*, I have established many social relationships in the high school environment as time goes by, and thus developed a deeper awareness of the intricacies of human interactions. Such experiences can enable me to navigate through personal relationships with more empathy and more emotional intelligence. Overall, the last year has sculpted a more mature and well-rounded version of me, equipped with the acquisition of deeper academic knowledge and interpersonal complexities. | - Topic-front (maturity)  - Extrinsic motivation mentioned  - Academic and social aspect  - No consideration mentioned |
| **Lam(5-2/4)** | I would say that much has changed ever since I got into highschool. Most noticeably has got to be **my maturity**, looking back at it, the me three years ago was somewhat brazen. I was sort of rude to people I did not know and was quite impetuous. Now, *I have grown to respect others and have learned social manners and etiquette*s. One facet that really changed for the better was **my feelings towards studying**. Back then, I used to disdain sitting at my table to research documents and read books;however, more recently *I have become more autodidactic,becoming someone who enjoys the mundane tasks or one that does not mind spending hours contemplating a piece of literature*. Though I still have a long way to go, *I would regard myself as a person with a lot more depth than I previously did.* | Not topic-front ( personal growth and attitude) maturity and feelings.

The given table compares the number in millions of tourists welcomed by nine destinations over two consecutive years 2009 and 2010 alongside their corresponding change rates in percentage terms.

**Data analysis (trends + patterns + ranking)**

France: constant/ unchanged / same - **a record high of** 76

=> always / all-time highest/ consistently higher

=> sustainable development

=> most appealing tourist attraction

=> welcome the greatest number of visitors in both years

Hongkong: the only country to witness a reduction in visitor numbers, correlating to a negative change rate of 11%

=> least favoured destination

=> welcome the lowest …

=> lose …

Others/ remaining categories: increase, yet to varying degrees

=> **Overview**

By and large, all the nations witnessed an increasing popularity in tourism except for France and Hong Kong whose figures also occupied the respective top-notch and bottommost positions.

Overall, bar France’s stability and HongKong’s downward pattern, all the other countries gained prevalence in their inbound tourism.

**Detailed analysis**

A closer inspection of the table indicates **an opposing pattern in France and Hong Kong**. While **the former** registered at a record high of 76 million in both years, reflecting a zero change rate, t**he latter** experienced a rare minus growth all over the board, evidenced by a drop of 11% to 9 million in 2010.

Regarding the US, Spain, the UK and Italy, these countries reported **a marginal increase** of 1 or 2 million in the tourist numbers. Specifically, the US and Italy retained second and fifth position respectively with 67 and 45 million in the final year. Also notable is the switch in ranking between Spain and the UK as the UK’s figure exceeded Spain’s by 1 million to claim the third position with 57 million.

As for the remaining countries, Turkey, China and Germany had the most significant development in inbound tourism, exemplified by an identical rise of 12 million visitors. However, their change rates varied widely depending on their initial level. For example, Turkey claimed 33% in the change rate and shared the same ranking with Italy. Most noticeably, Germany’s figure more than doubled to 23 million in 2010, **equivalent to** an impressive 109%, still being the second lowest.

\*To sum up, it can be inferred from the chart that the rate of change was of no significance as the number of tourists in the second year bore little difference to the final ranking of all the nations surveyed, except for the cases of the UK and Turkey.

| Bao | Lam would like to learn how to work out effectively and gain a physique similar to his 2d idol.  => Lam’s reaction: 😮, very true , i want to become more aesthetic. I want to cosplay in the near future. | It recently dawned on me that my sleep hours are lessening by the day due to the sheer amount of homeworks and classes that I have to attend. This is in no way good for me as *a good rest is extremely important for my physical and mental health*. Moreover, science has also proven that adolescence requires at least 8 hours of sleep per day to ensure good health and growth. Furthermore, **a better study schedule** would be greatly beneficial for my productivity as studying for long hours without adequate rest may lead me to become burnt-out and fall behind my peers. All in all, I am looking for ways to better organise my time to improve my productivity and mental health. | * Intrinsic motivation * No weakness mentioned. |
| Phuc | Bao would learn to bolster his time-management skills and ensure an adequate sleep every night. Bao is suffering from PTSD and sleep deprivation.  => Bao’s reaction: I don't have PTSD tho. Apart from that, it’s true that i want to sleep more than 6 hours everyday :’) | Recently, i have delved into multiple recreational activities, one of which can be **professional gaming**. I am not actually referring to egregious and self-destructive addition but as a **socializing and PR tool.** For example, I found that esport is a fertile ground for many relations and a foundation for a **lucrative career**. However, my skills are reprehensible and I often disheartened my fellow teammates with vanquishing defeat. Therefore, enhancing my gaming skills would essentially be the pancera to all my pitfalls, | No motivation  Disadvantages: Yellow highlight |
| Lam | Phuc wants to enhance his gaming skills. He said that he wants to be the very best that no one ever was.  ⇒ Phuc recation: Everything said is virtually true. | **Health** has always been a priority of mine, and **working out** is an aspect that I pay a reasonable amount of attention to for myriad reasons. Firstly, *I personally believe that training my body is both physically and mentally beneficia*l. Ever since I started working out at home, I have felt much better, my posture has improved, I have much less stress and looking at how my body has grown definitely cheers me up. Secondly, *I have a dream of cosplaying different characters from various TV-shows and mangas, most of which are really muscular and bulky men*. Taking that into account, I have diligently worked to achieve my goals and am getting closer each day. Unfortunately, I have to shift my focus towards my studies which inhibits my training progress, but I will return to getting fit and building muscle as soon as I find the time. In conclusion, although it might seem far-fetched, *I aspire to have the physique of fictional figures*. That is my main motivation to work out, and it has cultivated in me a good mental health, as well as a pleasing appearance . | Intrinsic motives. |
| Vi | Son wants to escape from dangerous situations where he has to swim  ⇒ son: fr fr | The ocean has always held a dear place in my heart. It continues to be my “safe place”, somewhere I can always go to whenever I am in need of support or a sense of clarity. *However, I am embarrassed to say that I cannot swim despite living in close proximity to it*. Many encouraged me to learn swimming once they knew that I did not know how to swim, not aware that I have taken part in many swimming courses and classes during my primary and secondary school years. Therefore, I wish to be able to **swim** in the near future so as to become one with the waves. | - Intrinsic motivation  - No effect  - No determination |
| Son | Hao would like to learn fencing because he wants to hone his strength and precision skills  => Hao: that’s precise and straight to the point | My hometown is situated in a place where water sources are abundant and that the local people are very adept at **the art of swimming**. However, as I had moved out a number of years before I could get a chance to learn it, *I do not know how to swim. Moreover, since my trip back home earlier this year had sparked my interest in the deep blue sea*, I have been training hard to be able to swim. The reasons why I prioritise this over other activities is, in my opinion, the relative importance of it to me. For the aforementioned reasons, and the fact that there lies a myriad of dangerous situations where I have to swim to safety, I have decided to put swimming on the top of my bucket list of things to do by the end of this year. | - Intrinsic motives  - No effects  - No weaknesses B) |
| Hao | Vi would like to learn how to swim because it’s good for job prospects  => Vi’s reaction: True | Provided that I am not constrained by time or money, I would definitely learn **the sport of fencing.** There are multiple reasons why I prefer fencing over other endeavours. Firstly, I practised Taekwondo at an early age but dropped it because I had to focus on school. I want to *reconnect with my martial arts background while learning something new at the same time.* Secondly, I believe fencing is good for the mind and body as it is a sport that exacts rigorous physical and mental training to improve agility and precision. *Taking on fencing would allow me to work on aspects of myself that were neglected in favour of academics*. In short, fencing is an excellent choice for me to further my martial arts pursuits in a new field while also honing my body and mind. | * Intrinsic motives * No effect |
| Kiet | Linh Anh would like to learn crocheting. It is the same as knitting; however, the technique is somewhat different. You use the hook and connect the yarns to make stuffed animals, bags and handmade clothes.  => Lanh’s reaction: yepp, and I’m currently learning it now | As a proud former comic and art advocate, I choose **Art** as my next competence to learn *after having witnessed numerous scenic artworks and realistic human portraits on the Internet*. In other words, I want to *be capable of expressing my own imagination and emotions freely through the paintings*. In addition, I have always had a preference towards drawing since I was young; however, my lack of time would not allow me, up to this point. Therefore, subsequent to my high school years, I would love devote more time into learning how to draw proficiently and produce several piece of arts. From my perspective, it is an amazing skill to have to showcase to my relatives and friends. Furthermore, it may be beneficial in the future as well, what if I got the chance to become a police sketch artist and arrest criminals? | Both intrinsic and extrinsic |
| Linh Anh | Tue would like to learn about general designs. He finds designing very useful especially in his presentations so he wants to learn background design skills and make nice presentations. However, he thinks this will take a lot of time to fully grasp  ⇒ Tue’s reaction: completely true | If there is something that I desperately want to learn about, I would say it is **the art of crochet,** which involves using a hook and yarn to crochet different products. A couple of months ago, I saw *a Tiktok video on very cute crochet products that people made*, and that was when I decided to pick up crocheting one day. **I** *find crocheting really versatile* since I can create a wide range of handmade products such as stuffed animals, bags, key chains and stunning pieces of clothings and gift them to my close friends. Crocheting is also *a good way to relieve stress and anxiety* after a demanding day at school. Since I picked up this as a hobby, I’ve learned to become more resilient and patient because some products require considerable amount of time and effort. Currently, I have only grasp basic techniques on crocheting and create simple products, so in the near future, I am hoping to further develop my skills and productivity to crochet more products | * Extrinsic motivations * Positive effect * No weaknesses mentioned |
| Tue | Kiet would like to learn how to draw. He wants to flex with his friends or families about his beautiful drawings, which can make him more outstanding.  => Kiet’s honest reaction: absolutely true | One thing I would love to develop is **my self-study skill** which seems to be of great importance in this technology-dominated world. *First, Because I am inclined towards social studies, I may not catch up with my friends in scientific subjects who have innate interests for such subjects. Second, the limited time per class can also hinder the teacher’s ability to convey ideas outside and beyond the coursebooks*. Due to the two aforementioned reasons, Should I heavily rely on the teachers and not further my knowledge base by myself, I will run the risk of lagging behind in this ever-changing world where facts and information are constantly revised and updated. This disadvantage can be remedied by an autodidactic method which can enable me to learn at my own pace with the myriad resources available on the Internet. This would not only facilitate the consolidation of my knowledge learned at schools but also the acquisition of new knowledge and skills, which could undoubtedly better equip me to cope with this ever-evolving world. However, I should also ask for the teacher’s guidance so as not to be bewildered at the colossal amount of knowledge available online. | - Topic front  - Both intrinsic and extrinsic reasons  - Effect mentioned  - Support mentioned  - Weakness mentioned  - Plan mentioned |

| --- | --- | --- |
| Hao | The text elucidates why people experience culture shock and the phases they go through. This feeling of estrangement and vexation stems from exposure to foreign culture and surroundings. There are three main stages to culture shock with different emotional responses. Initially, a foreign environment can excite people with novelty and new experiences. After an extended period of stay, feelings of disillusionment and frustration arise as newcomers struggle to grasp the locals’ culture and way of communication. Though hard to overcome, this phase is temporary, and individuals eventually adapt to their new environment. In the final stage, people fully accept their circumstances and can live comfortably in the hitherto unfamiliar community. (110 words) | author??? |
| Bao | The passage discusses the definition, stages and profound effects of culture shock. The term refers to unpleasant feelings resulting from unfamiliarity with environments and practices. Initially, culture shock may go unnoticed, overshadowed by the sense of curiosity and excitement. However, after long periods of time, disorientation and irritation can set in when faced with foreign cultures. This phase, while arduous, is not impossible to overcome as people start to adapt and assimilate into society. The final stage, acceptance, comes with the acknowledgement that a complete understanding of foreign cultures is not needed to be a functional citizen. (97 words) |  |
| Phuc | The given excerpt illustrates the features and different stages of cultural shock. Cultural shock refers to the turmoils and consternation stemming from deviation from the host environment. The pinnacle of cultural shock is manifested in the initial state, honeymoon which is bristled with exuberance and curiosity. However, this phenomenon does not linger but rather is short-lived in long-term exposure. The follow-up stage entails exhaustion and pent-up exasperation as newcomers can not gauge indigenous people’s behaviors. Consequentially, communicational breakdowns added with a sense of homesickness further aggravated this phenomenon. Though surpassing cultural shock can be Herculean, it is not insurmountable as positive attitudes are built up thanks to incremental familiarity. The last phase, acceptance involves the gradual reconciliation of new settings and a decent extent of familiarity. (126 words) |  |
| Lam | The passage presents the features and experiences of culture shock throughout its main stages. Culture shock is an amalgam of the emotions one feels when being in an aberrant environment, which includes anxiety and frustration. During the honeymoon phase, people usually feel ardour when exposed to dissimilar surroundings; however, this is only transient. Disorientation occurs in the following stage, along with depression and homesickness. This stage, albeit of utmost difficulty, is not insurmountable as the syndromes dwindle, and familiarity further develops. **The last stage is when individuals realise that functionality is not dependent on an in-depth understanding of foreign culture. Consequently, acceptance and comfortability are prominent in this process.** (109 words). |  |
| Vi | The extract elucidates culture shock and its three stages of adapting to a new environment. Culture shock is the feeling of unease when experiencing an unfamiliar environment. During the first stage, usually known as the “honeymoon phase”, the individual will feel excited to be in a new setting. However, this period does not last long. In the second stage, they will be in total discomfort since they cannot communicate well with others, leading to stress and fatigue. Finally, the person will come to accept and adapt to their living situation. They understand that being able to integrate completely into an unfamiliar surrounding is not necessary to enjoy the journey.  (109 words) |  |
| Son | The extract provides insights into culture shock alongside its phases and effects on people moving to another community. It is defined by negative emotions associated with travelling to another community, where the social norms, socially or behaviorally are different from that of the individual. Following a period of short-lived excitement and inquisitiveness comes times of distress and frustration as the individual tries to adapt to the surrounding milieu, which mostly affects those who decide to stay in such milieu for extended periods of time. However, if the person is able to acclimate, culture shock will gradually dissipate, and the feeling of distress and anxiety will soothe. (106 words.) |  |
| Tue | The extract elucidates the definition, mechanism and three main stages of culture shock. The phenomenon is associated with the emotion of disorientation when one travels to a new society. This happens due to the differences in cultures between various nations, leading to one’s unfamiliarity with the new environment. Initially, exposure to new surroundings can bring people thrill which; however, fades over time. Then, irritation sets in because of ineffective mutual communication, resulting in depression or homesickness. The final phase is acceptance where individuals have acknowledged that a comprehensive understanding of a culture is inessential and have effectively familiarised themselves with the new atmosphere.  (103 words) |  |
| Kiet | The extract elucidates the definition of cultural shock and its three primary stages. Cultural shock, which comes from the sense of unfamiliarity within the environment, causes depression and anxiety in a person. The first phase, being the early potent stage when someone moves overseas. Subsequently, as the initial enthusiasm fades, frustration and perplexity occur. Communication difficulties contribute to resentment, which accentuate depression and homesickness. However, as time passes, cultural shock diminishes as individuals fully immerse themselves in the alien nation. The eventual stage, known as the acceptance stage, is when travellers become accustomed to the culture and life of the foreign community. (102 words) |  |
| Linh Anh | The passage elaborates on the definition, followed by the descriptions of different stages of culture shock. Typically, culture shock is the phenomenon of anxiety and confusion emerging during one’s exposure to a foreign culture. This experience is classified into 3 main stages. Initially, the “honeymoon” stage occurs when people are intrigued with the brand new surroundings. As time elapses, frustration creeps in due to the cultural differences, which leads to a period of homesickness and depression. This distressing episode is conquered once travelers familiarize themselves in the final acceptance stage. **Acceptance does not require people to grasp the culture inside out, but it emphasizes the comfortability within the unfamiliar place.**(110 words) |  |

Learning lots of languages

A question many people ask is whether it’s possible to learn many different languages, and if so, how to do it. Well, here are some answers.

Any language consists of vocabulary, grammar and sounds. However, the culture of where the language is spoken also contributes towards understanding a language. Therefore, learners need to make sure they have a good understanding of culture as well as language.

Some people wrongly believe that learning many things at the same time will speed up the process when, in fact, it damages it. With this in mind, learning a maximum of two languages at any one time is a good idea. Three languages are too many and will slow down learning. The modern world is obsessed with speed and wanting everything done by tomorrow. This is particularly harmful to language learning – learners need to spend at least two years learning their chosen languages before moving on to the next ones.

While we’re talking about time, only spending a few minutes reading some words from a dictionary each day is not going to get anyone far in learning a language. It’s necessary to have around two hours per day which can be used to focus on language learning.

Some languages are quite similar to others in that they often share vocabulary and grammar, for example, and this can cause confusion. Choosing two languages that are very different from each other is advisable. Learning Spanish and Italian at the same time, for example, is not a good approach because they’re too alike. Instead, one way of helping learning is to choose an ‘easy’ language and a relatively ‘difficult’ one. By ‘easy’, I mean one that’s related to a language you already know, whereas the ‘difficult’ one might be totally unlike anything you’ve learned before. Giving the more ‘difficult’ language about 75 percent of study time, and the ‘easy’ one about 25 per cent should be about right.

And finally, to learn anything well, it has to be practised regularly, so be sure to study the languages every day. Good luck!

**Trams**

If you live in a city, you’re likely to spend many hours each year sitting in **traffic jams**. This can be a major problem, and one way of tackling it is to encourage people to use cars less by improving **public transport.** Cities worldwide are trying to provide better bus and train services, but many also want to extend their tram systems or introduce new ones. However, as with railways, constructing a tram system takes considerable time. So, why build a tram system?

One important point is that trams cause very little pollution because they **run on electricity**. At a time when environmental damage and climate change are serious issues, this is a major consideration. Another clear benefit is that tram tracks are cheaper to build than railway lines, although most experts agree that towns and cities need railways and underground systems as well.

Many cities around the world have had trams since the 19th century. In the Australian city of Melbourne, for example, they were first introduced in 1884, and there are now 24 tram routes and over 250 kilometres of track in the city. Robert Clayton, a Melbourne transport expert, says that the city council considered closing the system in the 1980s. ‘But fortunately, they dropped those plans,’ says Clayton. ‘We’re lucky. Melbourne streets are mostly wide and we don’t have the problem which some cities with narrow streets have. In those places, other traffic gets stuck behind trams – there’s not enough space to drive around them.’

Clayton explains that because tram tracks are fixed, people know that a tram route will never change. ‘It’s not the same with buses,’ he says. ‘Their routes get changed from time to time for various reasons. And although trams are noisier than buses, people here say they’re more comfortable for passengers to ride in. **After all, isn’t that one of the most important things?’**

=> justify

=> more merits than demerits

Drawbacks -> Benefits -> confirmed by Clayton

Check-in session: Work in pairs/ groups of 3. Chit chat with your friend and try to get to know more about each other.

| Name | One thing I have got to know about my friend | Reflections/ Comments | Ask your teacher questions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Khanh Vi | Son is a friend I just got to know recently because he studies in a different school. I found him to be quite extraverted, fun to talk to and learn from. | Son: fr fr | Why did you choose to go abroad? |
| Sy Son | Tue is good at listening and writing, since he listens to bbc everyday and practices writing very much. He also like vietnamese food, not least street vendors | Tue : I’m not that good at listening and writing. 🥲 | messi or ronando |
| Do Tue | Vi used to live in Australia when she was a kid. Now she is currently living in BMT city. She loves playing basketball. She is also partial to reading comic books. Her weakness is her writing skill. | Oh I don’t really like playing basketball or any sports in general  Hao: why are you bald? | What’s your favourite Vietnamese food? |
| An Phuc | Kiet is my bestmate, he is a genuine friend who always aid me in my studying. Kiet is quite able-bodied and engage in various recreation activities such as football and volleyball. To elucidate, in his previous year in a private school, Kiet actually obtained the leading positions in the school football leagues. Moreover, he also excels at intellectual activities such as chess and videogaming. Last, Kiet is essentially a connoisseur in English. He is a core and youngest member of the NEC team. To sum up, i fell very blessed to have Kiet as my sidekicks and fellow companion in an arduous journey named NEC. | To be honest, some of the mentioned activities are pretty much made up and overexaggerated. For instance, I never excelled at football 🙁H.  son 👍 | Where are you currently living? What is your marital status at the moment, do you have any kids? |
| Minh Kiet | Phuc is an dependent person, he lives in the dormitory and always goes to school late. However, he is truly a good person and someone to rely on. For example, during our biology tests, he helped me on studying for the test.  Moreover, he adores playing video games, but at a certain degree only. He usually overexaggerate stuff, like how he described me above. | → It is actually the other way around, kiet help but my score was higher than him 😂😂😂. | What do you think about the 2024 USA presidential election?  What do you think about Australia? |
| Duc Bao | Hao likes barbecue noodles, and he wishes to follow economics. His hometown is a traditional village. He comes back to his hometown at least once a year. He has a twin brother studying the same class who wants to study overseas. Hao is interested in foreign history and is currently studying Japanese. | That’s true, I don’t study Japanese bro, only on Duolingo.    (Bao)That is still learning japanese :))) wdym | If i asked you to recommend me a book what would say? :D  The Hate U Give  Thank you for your recommendations, i will check them out.  What kind of movie or culture are you most interested in? :O |
| Nhat Hao | Bao wants to work in IT, his family came from suburban Hanoi but it’s been over 10 years since they came there. He now has more relatives in HCM than in Hanoi. If he had to choose, he would choose to live in HMCC. His brother is currently studying electronics at the polytechnic academy in HCM. | Are you more interested in my family than me or smth :))’. But all of it is correct  (Lam):Bao’s resemblance to his brother is almost uncanny  (Bao): Would be a problem if i didn't | What university did you go to?  ULIS |
| Linh Anh | Lam likes reading manga in his free time, recently he has been taking up light novels as well. He is quite a stoic person and he loves doing things that suits his liking and satisfaction. He’s also quite a dramatic person (overdramatic in my opinion) He thinks a good friend needs to help each other to improve and become a better person as a whole. A good friend has to point out his mistakes. And he is also willing to support and emphathize with his friends too. | Yes i do like reading manga and comics, some of my favorites are jujutsu kaizen and chainsaw man. | How long have you been teaching abroad?  What are the tips that you recommend to people who want to study abroad? (like me) :>  Okayy thank god I know how to cook :D  How do you feel about Australia, is it a beautiful and picturesque country like those TV shows describe?  Do you miss Vietnam sometimes and how often do you travel back to Vietnam?  Awww |
| Ngoc Lam | Linh Anh sometimes plays basketball. She likes playing gacha games. She describes herself as a shy and awkward person. She thinks that a good friend should be able to empathise, and should be the emotional support for people around them. She enjoys traditional Vietnamese food | Linh Anh: No comment, the fact that recently I have been playing less gacha games though :”> | What is your opinion on japanese culture and more particularly on animated cartoons.  What are the reasons that bring you to Australia and are you living there or are you just working?  What time is it in Australia now? |

| Name | Paragraph writing | Comments/ Analysis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hao | I believe my most recent achievement is **having survived another week of school**, *thereby having the weekend to catch up on homework and learn what I actually enjoy*. I believe you have to find happiness in the mundane, putting all you’ve got into doing simple tasks or jobs is an achievement in and of itself. A few days off is the reward for doing one week’s worth of classwork dutifully. I don’t condone the “live for the weekends” mindset, but I do believe we have to work hard to achieve what we want in life, and have to accept that the weekends are well-earned rewards.  -> Linh Anh: The text depicts the author’s recent achievement at school and provides reasons and consideration for it | Aspect: academic/everyday life  Topic front  Explanation mentioned  Intrinsic motivation mentioned: to achieve  Effect mentioned (Instant effect. Aspect: self-fulfilment ) |
| Linh Anh | One of my most recent achievement that I’m really proud of is the fact that I get to **attend this online class as one of the most gifted English students in my province.** To be able to get into the National English team is like a dream come true for me, not even in my wildest dream would I think I could get into the team TvT, there are no words I can use to describe my *surprise and happiness* then. Although it was quite a close call, I’m glad that I made it. In the team I’ve been trying my best to *practice my writing, reading and most importantly, listening and my vocabulary range,* since those two skills have always been my weaknesses. I can see that *I’ve made some progress*, but I’m still nowhere near as good as my peers so perhaps I will have to try harder to catch up.  Hao: The text elucidates the author’s recent achievement of getting into the NEC team and misgivings about the opportunity. | Academic  Topic front  No reason mentioned  Instant effect: aspect: emotion  Academic effect |
| Vi | I have always done terribly in Chemistry so getting above a 6 in my mid-term exam was something I regarded as an amazing feat that I never could hope to achieve. So you can imagine my surprise when I found out that I **passed my exam with a 7.5** no less, considering that I got a 2 in my previous test. I definitely consider it as a stroke of luck though, since I still do not understand a thing about Chemistry to this day.  Lam: The text justifies the author’s latest academic achievement as a chance of luck. | Aspect: Academic  Not topic front Neither intrinsic nor extrinsic No effect mentioned  The text likens the author’s latest academic achievement to luck. |
| Lam | I rarely really do anything that,in my opinion, is worth being called an achievement. However, recently, I have **made progress in writing essays.** Since my writing skills have always been subpar, it can be quite demoralising to know that i am not on the same level as my peers, but in the past month or so *i have made improvements* and to me that is a ver*y rewarding experience*. Another thing that i would say i am quite pleased to be able to have is **the ability to sit through a text-only book**, which previously would have been very challenging for me, considering my attention span.  Vi: The text highlights the writer’s achievement in writing and attention expansion. | Personal and academic    Not topic front.  Intrinsic and extrinsic  academic-> academic related effects-> popularity.  No consideration mentioned |
| Phuc | Throughout my life, I have been given the opportunity to witness many epoch-making, radical transformatations. **However, recently my most pronounced achivement was getting into the NEC team of Nguyen Du.** Getting into the team was the best thing that has happened to me, albeit being ascribed partly to luck and my execrable handwriting. The period following the filtering exame however was rife with emotional turmoil and consternation. For fear of failing to pass would be parallel to the **futility** of all my efforts. *Moreover, having jeopardized all my life for English, a departure from mainstream education would only spell doom for me. However, I managed to scrape through the exam. My feeling was quite* ***poignant*** *actually, following a sense of* ***relief*** *then comes the prelimanry feelings between the exams. Therefore in the following months, i would probably assume a new of* ***responsibility*** *for English*  *Bao:* This passage elaborates on the writer’s recent achievement in joining the NEC and the positive effects it had on the author. | Aspect: Academics  Topic front:  Motivation: Not given  Academic achievments and therapuetic upshots  → Long-term sense of responsibility  Concession: Purple highlight  Countervailing Hypothethesis (reductio ad absurdum): Blue highlight |
| Bao | One of my most recent achievements has to be that I **got a near perfect score in the mid-term Physics examination yesterday, a 9.7 to be exact**. I am *very proud* of this result due to the fact that I had to prepare for other classes and exams as well so I didn't have much time to review my lessons . However, this result has also *troubled me quite a bit* as the question that i got wrong was not particularly difficult and I had made the same mistake before :<.  Phuc: The given excerpt discusses(scrutinizes) the writer’s recent immaculate scorings in Physics and his rueing procilivities for an unnecessary mistake. | -Aspect: Academic  -Topic front  -No motivation mentioned  -Short-term effect  -No consideration  Scruntinise |
| Son | One of my more recent achievements was **second place in the Vietnamese equivalent of science fair**, but on a provincial level. Involving 185 teams and over 350 competitors, me and my friend Almond are lucky to be one of 14 teams that managed to be almost on the top, only missing a few points from getting first place. I went to this competition because she wanted a translator as well as a companion to attend this fair. *Alas, we shared the price money for reaching 2nd place; it is not much though*  Kiet: The extract delineates the author’s experience and the incentive of their participation in a science fair. | - Academic  -Topic front (probably)  - Extrinsic motive (wants to help almond get her prize)  - Short-term ($), relationship-related effects (better friendship with almond)  - no emotion  - no mentioned concession (we worked very hard) |
| Tue | I want to tell you guys about **my chance to get into the NEC team, which is one of the things I’m proudest of**. I used to be a very ordinary student in my class last year. I was so self-conscious about my skills at that time because my classmates showed a much better performance than me. This instilled in me a tendency to undermine my abilities, and a way of pessimistic thinking that I cannot catch up with my peers. **However, I always think of myself as an ambitious person who will try his best to pursue or achieve his goals**. Over time, I gradually honed my skills step by step, which obviously enabled me to enter the NEC team. *In hindsight, I would say I’m very grateful that I had exerted myself at that time.*  Son: the text recounts the author’s gratefulness and motivation about being a member of the NEC team | * Academic achievement * Topic front * Intrinsic motivation * Instant effect :   Academic -> Emotions (fortitude)   * No consideration mentioned |
| Kiet | One obvious achievement is of course, **getting into the team to compete for the National English Competition**. However, last year, I managed to get **second place in the provincial English competition**, as well as **first place among the 10th graders in 10/3 (somewhat similar to 30/4 of HCMC).** I nearly lost the chance to be in the NEC qualifying team because of my recklessness in time-management and self-care, leading to a poor result in the first round. Nonetheless, I managed to retrieve my form and *secured 1st place in the school’s qualifiers in the 2nd round.* Besides that, I have also acquired **2 bronze chess medals** by competing against my chess club members and the students of my school.  Tue: The passage highlights the author’s academic achievement in NEC and their achievement in terms of sports, namely in chess. | -Academic + sport achievements  -Topic front (both)  -Intrinsic motivation  -Instant effect: Academic related  -No emotion mentioned  -No consideration mentioned |

**Summarising techniques**

1. Work in pairs. You read your friend’s writing and answer the question: What is the text about? - 1 sentence

Wrap-up: Source/ genre / title + reporting verb + key message (sketch) => Thesis statement

1. Reporting verb: present simple; 1-word verbs > multiple word verbs
2. Key message: keywords/ aspects / causal relationship
3. Nouns > Verbs; Noun phrases > Verb phrases
4. And -> alongside/ as well as / before / prior to / followed by …

* *The given text explains…*
* *In ‘…’, the author highlights …*
* *In the text entitled ‘ …’, … is presented.*
* *‘...’ by* ***author*** *clarifies …*

Main info = key message: aspects - in order

**Practice**

Culture shock is the feeling of uncertainty, confusion, or anxiety that people experience when visiting, doing business in, or living in a society that is different from their own. Social norms can vary significantly across countries and regions. Culture shock can arise from an individual's unfamiliarity with local customs, language, and acceptable behavior.

Culture shock is usually most intense at the beginning of a stay abroad - but in a good way. At first, people are usually thrilled to be in their new environment, and they see it as an adventure. If someone is on a short stay, this initial excitement may define the whole experience. However, if someone has moved to the new locale on a long-term basis, this "honeymoon" phase will eventually end.

As the initial glee of being in a new environment wears off, people grow increasingly irritated and disoriented. Fatigue sets in with the **misunderstanding** of others' actions or conversation, ways of doing or operating things, habits: all the little other nuances of speech, appearance, and behavior that are instinctively understood at home.

The **inability to effectively communicate**—to interpret what others mean and to make oneself understood—is usually the prime source of frustration. This, the most difficult period of culture shock, is when depression or homesickness and longing for the familiar and comfortable become most prominent.

Culture shock can be tough to overcome, but the syndrome often does dissipate over time. As a traveler becomes more familiar with a place, the people, customs, food, and language become more **palatable and comfortable**. Navigation of surroundings gets easier. Friends are made. And everything gets a little more comfortable.

Following this period of adjustment comes the final stage of culture shock: acceptance. Acceptance doesn’t mean that new cultures or their values, beliefs, and attitudes are completely understood. Rather, it signifies a realisation that complete understanding isn’t necessary to function and thrive in the new surroundings. **During the acceptance stage, travellers have gained the familiarity they need to feel more comfortable with life in a foreign society.**

| **Name** | **What I can recall from the text** | **Thesis statement** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hao | The text elucidates the phenomenon of culture shock. This feeling of estrangement stems from exposure to a foreign culture. There are three main stages to culture shock with different emotional responses. Initially, a foreign environment can excite people with novelty and new experiences. In the second phase, disillusionment sets in and people get homesick. Lastly, individuals accept their situation and largely adapt to the new environment. | The text elucidates the phenomenon of culture shock.  => tooooooo broad |
| Bao | Culture shock refers to unpleasant feelings resulting from unfamiliar environments and customs. This phenomenon may be unharmful at first as it is accompanied by curiosity and excitement. However, after long periods of time, disorientation and irritation can set in due to many unfamiliarities. This can be detrimental to one’s mental health. This can be overcome with time. Còn lại em quên r :Đ | The text elaborates on (discusses) the three stages of culture shock and their profound effects on one’s mental health.\  Definition |
| Phuc | The notion of cultural shock (turmoils and consternations deprived from deviation from host environments).  Pinnacle of cultural shock is manifested in the initial stage of any visits, whereby honeymoon is presented. This stage is bristled with exuberance and curiosity but its effect is rather short-lived in the longg-term.  Exhaustion and pent-up exasperation to gauge foregin people’s behaviour is the main chateristics of cultural shock (homesickness aggravated this phenononmenon)  Communication breakdown.
