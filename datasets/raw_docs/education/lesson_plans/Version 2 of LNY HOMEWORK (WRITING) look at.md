1. The pie chart below shows the main reasons why agricultural land becomes less productive. The table shows how these causes affected three regions of the world during the 1990s.

The given pie chart details the main causes for the productivity recession of agricultural land, while the table demonstrates how these factors affected North America, Europe and Oceania.

As can be seen from two charts, over-grazing appears to be the cornerstone of worldwide land degradation, followed by deforestation and over-cultivation. Additionally, Europe witnessed the most severe land degradation.

With respect to the pie chart, overgrazing was highest9++- at 35%, followed closely by deforestation and over-cultivation, each contributing nearly one-third of the overall recession. Meanwhile. the remaining 7% representing not explicitly stated causes, has a relatively minor impact.

Regarding the table, Europe has the largest proportion of degraded land, occupying 23% of the total, primarily due to deforestation with nearly one in ten. Besides that, over-cultivation and over-grazing are not far behind, with 2.1% gap and 4.3% gap, respectively. The percentage of eroded land in Oceania was responsible for an overwhelming 13% of the land surface area, with overgrazing being the dominant cause at 11.3%. In terms of North America, there is only 5% of the overall land being devastated. In contrast to Europe, where over-cultivation is a significant contributor, this issue in North America is less pronounced, with over-cultivation representing just over 3%, doubling the impact of overgrazing.

2. The chart below gives information about how families in one country spent their weekly income in 1968 and 2018. Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make comparisons where relevant.

*(image removed)*The given bar chart demonstrates the percentage of weekly income expenditure on different categories by families in one country in 1968 and 2018.

Overall, in 1968, families allocated the largest portion of their income to food, whereas in 2018, housing and leisure became the primary expenses. Despite these shifts, spending on household goods remained relatively consistent.

In 1968, food represented the most significant expenditure, comprising 35% of weekly income. However, by 2018, this figure experienced a sharp decline to approximately 15%. Likewise, expenditure on clothing and footwear was halved from 10% in 1968, while spending on fuel and power dropped slightly, decreasing by 2%. Similarly, spending on fuel and power decreased moderately, falling to roughly one-third of the 5% recorded in 1968.

On the other hand, spending on housing nearly doubled, increasing from 10% in 1968 to around 20% in 2018. Leisure witnessed the most substantial growth, emerging as the highest category at just over 20%, a significant rise from under 10%. Transport costs also climbed notably, rising from just below 10% to approximately 15%.

3. Some people believe young people should have the freedom to make mistakes while others argue that adults should prevent them from doing so. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

In this day and age, the debate over whether young people should have the freedom to make mistakes or be protected by adults remains a topic of discussion. In this essay, I will analyse both viewpoints and discuss my own opinion.

On one hand, making mistakes is a key part of personal development. Young individuals gain important life lessons through failure, which helps them become more independent and resilient. To elucidate, a student who performs poorly on an exam due to a lack of preparation will understand the value of time management and hard work. Undeniably/Indubitably/Undoubtedly/Indeed, encountering setbacks teaches perseverance and encourages creative problem-solving. Additionally, exploration and experimentation without excessive restrictions can foster innovation and personal growth.

On the other hand, guidance from adults is equally significant. Specifically, with their experience, adults can help young people avoid serious consequences. In particular, advising against unsafe behaviors can prevent harm, while teaching financial responsibility can avert numerous future problems. Consequently, adult supervision can reduce the risk of severe setbacks, allowing young individuals to develop in a safer environment.

Admittedly, constant interference might hinder their ability to learn self-reliance and make independent decisions. Accordingly, in my opinion, a balanced approach is ideal. Young people should be given the freedom to make minor mistakes and learn from them, while adults should prevent errors that could have serious consequences. This ensures a balance between personal growth and safety.

In conclusion, both perspectives have merits. Therefore, I believe that harmonious combination/ a symbiotic approach creates the most supportive environment for young people’s development.

4. In many countries, people are now living longer than ever before. Some people say an aging population creates problems for governments. Other people think there are benefits if society has more elderly people. To what extent do the advantages of having an aging population outweigh the disadvantages?

In many parts of the world, as people live longer, the aging population has become a prominent issue. While some argue that this creates significant challenges for governments, others highlight the benefits elderly people bring to society. This essay will explore both views and conclude that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages.

One notable benefit of an aging population is the wealth of experience and knowledge elderly individuals contribute. Many serve as mentors or advisors, providing guidance to younger generations in their personal and professional lives. Additionally, they often play crucial roles in family dynamics, helping to raise grandchildren and fostering intergenerational bonds. Economically, an aging population leads to increased demand in sectors like healthcare, tourism, and elderly care, creating job opportunities and stimulating growth. Take AARP (American Association of Retired Persons) as a prime example, it is an [organization](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/vi/dictionary/english/organization) in the US that [provides](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/vi/dictionary/english/provide) [support](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/vi/dictionary/english/support) and [advice](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/vi/dictionary/english/advice) to [people](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/vi/dictionary/english/people) [aged](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/vi/dictionary/english/aged) 50 and over. These shifts drive growth and innovation in healthcare, elderly care, and tourism.

However, the challenges posed by an aging population cannot be ignored. Governments face increased financial pressure as pension schemes and healthcare costs rise. Indeed, many developed countries are grappling with underfunded retirement systems due to the growing number of retirees. Furthermore, an aging population leads to a shrinking workforce, slowing economic growth. Consequently, industries like healthcare, elderly care, and tourism see growth due to rising demand, yet face labor shortages. Such shifts require targeted investments in workforce training and infrastructure to sustain long-term economic stability.

Despite these challenges, I believe the benefits outweigh the disadvantages. With effective policies, governments can mitigate the economic burden incurred by the aging population. It is undeniable that the wisdom and social contributions of elderly individuals are crucial in enriching communities and strengthening societal cohesion.

In conclusion, while an aging population presents some difficulties, its advantages are indicated in the fostering of social stability and economic growth. Accordingly, with strategic planning, including investments in workforce development and innovation, these challenges can be mitigated.
