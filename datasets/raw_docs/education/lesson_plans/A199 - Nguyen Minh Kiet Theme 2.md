The discussion surrounding the relevance of art and music in contemporary society amidst the pervasive influence of the modern world is a topic of heated debate. Personally, I believe that art and music remain vital in contemporary society, and this essay will provide pertinent illustrations to substantiate my view.

To commence with, art and music are integral to the human experience, serving as mediums for expression, cultural preservation, and emotional connection. In other words, these creative forms allow individuals to express complex emotions and ideas that transcend linguistic barriers. For example, Beethoven's symphonies continue to evoke deep emotional responses and are celebrated across cultures, demonstrating music's timeless impact.

Furthermore, the advancement of technology has transformed how we create, share, and experience art and music. To elucidate, digital platforms and tools have democratised access to these creative forms, enabling more people to participate in and appreciate them. For instance, platforms like YouTube and Spotify allow artists and musicians to reach a global audience, fostering a more inclusive cultural landscape. Moreover, technology has introduced new forms of art, such as digital painting and electronic music, expanding the boundaries of creative expression and cementing the role of art in contemporary society.

From my perspective, incorporating art and music into children's education is crucial in today's technological age. By engaging in artistic activities, children develop a sense of curiosity and innovation, which are essential for problem-solving and adapting to new challenges. One example is Finland, where the education system places a strong emphasis on art and music, resulting in well-rounded students who excel in various fields.

In conclusion, art and music undeniably retain their significance in modern society, enriched and expanded by technological advancements. Ensuring that children spend more time learning these subjects at school is imperative, as it nurtures essential skills and fosters a deeper appreciation for cultural heritage and personal expression.

There is a divergence of opinions regarding the creation of exceptional artworks, with some believing that it can be produced by anyone, while others argue that it necessitates innate talent and skill. In this essay, I will analyse both sides of the argument and present my own perspective with pertinent illustrations to support it.

On the one hand, there is a compelling argument that meticulous art requires outstanding competence and capability. To commence with, some individuals possess innate abilities that allow them to perceive and create art in ways that others cannot. For instance, the renowned painter Pablo Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent as a child, which was honed through years of dedicated practice.

On the other hand, it is equally valid to argue that anyone can create quality art with the right mindset and effort. Initially, art is a form of expression that is accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or innate abilities. For example, Vincent van Gogh, who is celebrated as one of the greatest painters in history, did not show any particular artistic prowess during his early years and only began painting in his late twenties. Additionally, the majority of his iconic works were created in the last few years of his life, demonstrating how late it was for him to achieve success. =>CHECK Additionally, the majority of his iconic works were created in the last few years of his life, highlighting his late bloom in achieving success.

From my perspective, both views hold merit; however, I believe that while innate talent can provide an advantage, the creation of quality art is primarily driven by unwavering passion and constant determination. Accordingly, by nurturing their creativity and continuously honing their skills, individuals can overcome initial limitations and achieve artistic excellence.

In conclusion, while special talent and ability can contribute to the creation of quality art, it is not an absolute requirement. I believe that with dedication and effort, anyone can develop the skills necessary to produce stunning masterpieces.
