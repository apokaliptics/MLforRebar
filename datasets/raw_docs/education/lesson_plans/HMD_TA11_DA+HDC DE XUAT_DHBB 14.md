Interviewer: Now, you've chosen businesses that seem worlds apart with regard to product and production and yet have startling similarities in terms of strategy. Could you tell us a little about these businesses created by young entrepreneurs?

Abbie: Yes, I decided to go with a clothing company, or rather a social clothing company as the owner, Chris, prefers to call it. This particular online company functions more like a blog than a conventional web store, which allows it to utilise the input from the blogger communities and the news cycles directly. Then, the elements highlighted by the members of those communities are incorporated into its designs. So, social engagement is key to its success with the emphasis on listening to people rather than dictating to them.

Ryan: Yes, it's definitely a case of having your finger on the public's pulse. And I believe the company I've selected does exactly that, but with an entirely different product - DIY electronic hardware kits. Not so long ago, consumers would demand their electronic gadgets ready-made and ready to use. Now, however, devoting time to assembling the gadgets is perfectly acceptable. The kits come with detailed instructions for assembly, but **customers are actively encouraged to modify the product so that it matches their particular taste. Then, customers have the opportunity to embrace the culture of sharing online to feed off each other's creativity**.

Abbie: That's another similarity with the company I've chosen. **Its customers don't just want to buy clothes; they want to be seen wearing them, too**. **After all, the target market is the younger generation whose social media profiles reflect the 'look at me' mentality**. The company has taken this into account and now invites customers to submit photos or videos of themselves wearing the company's products. Not surprisingly, there has been an overwhelming response from which the company has dearly benefitted. Firstly, there is the publicity aspect, which allows the company to advertise without spending huge sums. Secondly, and more importantly, this initiative has given the company access to information only available on social media and that is the speed of change in what the customer wants. Then, it's just a case of keeping pace with that change.

Ryan: I'm glad you brought up the element of speed and online companies having to adapt accordingly. Right from the outset, the founder, Limor, who did her master's at HIT, realised she would have to come up with new ideas all the time. As a result, she made sure she embarked on at least one new product per week mainly based on such technology as gyro metric sensors and solar panels. **Nowadays, her products, developed with her troubleshooting team of three engineers, cover a much wider range of technologies that appeal to every generation. There are kits for primary schoolchildren who can build robotic arms through to grandmothers who can sew clothes with working LED displays with conductive threads and washable hardware. This is probably the biggest difference between the two companies**.

Abbie: As you inferred, it's not only recognising the need for change but it's also adapting to it. At the moment, Chris's social clothing company aims to come up with three creations a week so as not to fall behind. **Incredibly, he plans to increase this rate to a mind-boggling twenty a week at least**, with about half designed through crowd-sourcing and collaborations with outside designers. With this in mind, he has formed manufacturing partnerships that ensure new inventory arrive in a matter of weeks, not months. As for managing the online catalogue, he aims to develop it in keeping with what works online. So again there are going to be novel ways of presenting items, I'm not sure what novel ways he's referring to, but I'm certain they'll be as creative as his clothing.

Ryan: And all this points to rapid development. Limor's company has sold over half a million kits in seven years, Over the same period, she has moved into a large warehouse that has enough space for storage and to accommodate equipment like laser engravers and mills. Therefore, every part can be manufactured on site. **If you look at the business now, and think back to how it started - the notion of providing people with the opportunity to gain a sense of achievement from making something on their own, which they obviously do - you'll be amazed**. But don't just stand there open-mouthed. Come up with your own idea and don't be afraid to go ahead with it.

Abbie: I'd like to echo that sentiment and ....
