| Linh Anh | Overview: all three surveyed food categories shared the same price in 1979 before witnessing an upward trend, with fresh fruits and vegetables seeing the most dramatic increase as opposed to sugar and sweets.  Paragraphing: degree of change  Paragraph 1: Fresh fruits and vegetable  surged and reached the peak of 325 in 2009, 4 times more than its starting point of only 75  Paragraph 2: Carbonated drinks and sugary food   * The cost of both types went up significantly and culminating at approximately 200 in 2009 * There was a small discrepancy between carbonated drinks and sweets with the former having higher cost.   Paragraph 3: Consumer-price index  Rising expenses of food sectors contributed to the growth of consumer-price index, evidenced by a triple increase to 150 in 2009 |  |
| Kiet | Overall, all three surveyed food items saw an upward trend over the 30-year period, correlating with the ascending trend of consumer-price index.Moreover, fresh fruits and vegetables category experienced the most prominent growth.  Paragraph 1: Carbonated drinks and sugary food:  +Sugars and sweets and carbonated drinks experienced similar growth rates, increasing by roughly 200.  +Carbonated drinks were consistently more expensive over the timeframe.  Paragraph 2: Fresh fruits and vegetables:  +Fresh fruits and vegetables became the most costly category, with their price more than quintupled.  +At the end of the period, the quote of this group is less competitive compared to the two other products.  Paragraph 3: Consumer-price index  +The consumer price index also increased over the period from 50 to 150.  +It is also well-under all three mentioned groups. |  |
| Vi |  |  |
| Phuc |  |  |
| Lam | Overall, the price range across all categories had a similar starting point and experienced significant growth, correlating with the notable rise of the CPI. The most pronounced increase in cost belonged to fresh fruits and vegetables, as opposed to sugar and sweets.    Paragraph1: fresh fruits and vegetables were affordable in 1979, at just over 50-> almost 7 times as much 30 years later.  Paragraph 2: Sugar and sweets, along with carbonated drinks had identical prevalence in quotes (quadruples). Although the discrepancy between the two prices widened over time-> ended up at approximately the same price of 200 in 2009.  Para 3: CPI clearly depicts the gradual ascent of item cost (rose exponentially, evidenced by a gap of 100 concluding with 150) |  |
| Bao | Overall, a gradual rise was observed in all categories within the first decade before diverging in 1989. The cost of fresh fruits and vegetables faced the most notable increase, contrasting carbonated drinks’ prices.  Paragraph 1: The price for fruits and vegetables witnessed many significant increments throughout the surveyed period:   * Nearly tripling within the first decade, from just above 50 to around 150 * Its price growth quickened from 1989 onwards, ending up at approximately 325 in 2009   Paragraph 2: The cost of sugar and sweets, alongside carbonated drinks experienced similar marginal growth trends over the time frame. However, their price gap widened over time with the former ending up at 200, 50 more than that of the latter  Paragraph 3: All of the aforementioned increases in price across all items lead to a progressive rise in CPI, almost tripling by 2009 at 150. |  |
| Hao |  |  |
| Tue | Overall : The surveyed categories all recorded the same starting point and an upward trend over the period shown, leading to an increase in the consumer-price index. Additionally, while the most significant rise in price went to fresh fruits and vegetables, the opposite was true for sugar and sweets  Paragraphing :  - Fresh fruits and vegetables :   * 1979 : 50 * 2009 : the price increased 7 times, costing around 350   - “Carbonated drink” and “sugar and sweets” : similar degree and change   * Quadruple growth (50 → 200)   - Conclusion : price increases in all surveyed categories correlated with the triple |  |

*(image removed)*

Depicted in the line chart are how many computers each U.S citizen possessed throughout 15 years commencing in 1997. The triennial statistics are gauged in percentage terms of the total population.

Initial inspection reveals the overall ascending trend in computer ownership in the U.S., **regardless of quantities**, correlating with the decrease in no-computer ownership. Also noteworthy is that the majority of the population owned at least one device.

A declining pattern was observed in the number of people in the U.S. possessing no computer. In 1997, there were seven out of ten people without possession of the device. However, the figure had consistently slid away till the end; one-fifth of the population had not had any item by 2012.

By stark contrast, there had been a significant growth in the U.S. computer ownership. The most pronounced was the data of one-item owners, whose remarkable increase indicated half of the population in 2009 from the initial 28%. The figure for those with multiple computers also witnessed an ascent, yet not significant enough to reflect overall universality. Merely 5% of the population had two computers in 1997, while almost no individual was recorded with up to three devices. From 2000 to 2009, both categories shared identical increasing trends, at 30% on aggregate. Nonetheless, while more and more people possessed two computers in the last interval, with approximately 22%, the figure for over 3-computer owners slightly decreased to under 10%.

**Detailed description**

Para 1:( No change) Sydney(highest) and Melbourne: regardless of water usage - Sydney 2nd - Melbourne: least **253**

Para 2: Brisbane (second highest): a gap of 3 cents -> second lowest

Para 3: Perth and Adelaide: a record low of **0.42** -> 1.50 and 1.00 => Perth: most costly : **332**

Conclusion (optional): Average bills tend to depend more on usage change over 125 KL, evidenced by similar rankings recorded in these two indicators.

**Sample**

Demonstrated is the table about the water prices for two divergent levels of consumption, up to and above 125KL in five Australian cities.

By and large, Perth residents shell for the highest household water bills, as opposed to Melbourne. Additionally, the average bill tends to depend more on usage change over 125 KL.

Upon closer inspection, no price discrepancy is observed in the usage changes in Sydney and Melbourne, at 0.98 and 0.71 respectively. Being in the top three for both categories, Sydney culminates to the second highest overall water cost at 319 dollars. By contrast, after 125KL, the same rate in Melbourne turns out to be the most competitive, correlating to the lowest level of 253 dollars in the average bill.

Meanwhile, there is a subtle increase of 3 cents from the second highest price of 0.81 dollars in Brisbane. Nevertheless, the price of water after the benchmark becomes the second lowest, making the average cost drop to a similar position, with 310 dollars.

Regarding the remaining cities, Perth and Adelaide have water prices for the first index in common, with the most affordable quote of 0.42 dollars, followed by a correspondingly triple and double increase to the highest levels post 125KL. Accordingly, these two enter the top three cities whose inhabitants need to cover the heftiest water bills, evidenced by a record high of 332 dollars in Perth.

| Tue | The given table compares five Australian cities in terms of the water prices and the median expenditure per household.  On the whole, it is noticeable that all surveyed areas underwent an increase in the cost of a kiloliter of water when the usage exceeds 125KL, **except for Melbourne and Sydney.** It can also be seen that the most notable rise in price went to Perth which also had the highest average spending per household.  A closer inspection of the table indicates a similar pattern between Adelaide and Perth which have the same price for a kililiter of water (up to 125KL) at $0.42. Additionally, these two cities also had the most significant growth in water prices with over 125KL of usage, with a threefold one for Perth and a twofold one for Adelaide. **As a result, Perth and Adelaide respectively ranked first and third regarding the average bill, at $332 and $310.**  By contrast, while Brisbane only saw a marginal rise in cost from $0.81 to $0.84 when the usage surpasses 125KL, its the median spending was almost as high as that of Adelaide.    As for the remaining regions, **both Melbourne and Sydney recorded no additional charge for over 125KL of water, charging a respective price of $0.78 and $0.98 per kiloliter.** However, while the median bill per household of Melbourne was significantly lower than that of other cities at $253, that of Sydney ranked second in the table at 319$.

| Hao | The table compares water prices in five different Australian cities.  Overall, all cities besides Perth have cost increases per kiloliter of 1 dollar or less. Additionally, Perth has the highest average household water bill.  Melbourne and Sydney are the only 2 cities whose water prices are consistent regardless of the number of kiloliters used, at 0.78 dollars and 0.98 dollars respectively. Furthermore, Melbourne has the lowest average household bill at 253 dollars while the figure for Perth is the highest, at 332 dollars.  Although Perth and Adelaide have the highest water prices after 125 kiloliters used at 1 dollar and 1.50 dollar respectively, their prices are the cheapest below 125 kiloliters of usage, at 0.42 dollars. Brisbane’s water price only increases 3 cents from 0.81 dollars after 125 kiloliters.

| Vi | The given table compares the water prices and average water bill per household in five metropolitan areas in Australia.  Overall, there is a rise in water cost in most cities after consuming over 125 Kl, notably in Adelaide and Perth. Moreover, all households residing in these areas possess a similar average water bill.  Adelaide’s water price for water consumption under 125kl is the same amount as Perth’s. These two cities are also the only to witness an upsurge in pricing for over 125kl of use, each amounting to $1.00 and $1.50. For under 125kl of water usage, Brisbane charges $0.81/kl and charges an additional $0.03 per kiloliter once over the threshold. The average bill per house in Adelaide and Brisbane are similar, at $310, while Perth is $20 higher.  Melbourne’s and Sydney’s cost remains the same regardless of the water quantity, having $0.78 and $0.98 respectively. The average bill for Melbourne is at its lowest of $253, which is $66 less than Sydney’s figure.  (162 words) | - Benchmark mentioned (Overview)  - No correlation  - City based |
| Lam | The table compares water prices in 5 distinct cities in Australia and presents changes in pricing when water usage exceeds 125 kiloliters.  Overall, every city witnesses a rise in cost once beyond the 125Kl mark, bar Melbourne and Sydney, with the former having the record low median bill per home.  An analysis r**eveals that there is no increase in water cost in Melbourne or Sydney regardless of consumption, evidenced by Sydney unchanging $0.98 charge, gaping Melbourne by $0.20.** These are also the highest prices for water below 125kl use.  For Adelaide and Perth, they were the most economical for under 125kl consumption at $0.42/kl; however, their pricing skyrockets upon further usage.Perth claims the all-time high of $1.50/kl, and Adelaide is only behind by $0.50. Most noticeably, Brisbane witnessed the most marginal prevalence in pricing, established by a difference of $0.03.  As for the average bill in each destination, Perth had the highest at $332, followed by Sydney with a discrepancy of 13. Adelaide and Brisbane have similar household checks of around $310, being $57 over that of Melbourne. (187 words) | Yes benchmark(both intro and overview) should only be once.

| Phuc | The given table delineated the charging schemes for water and average expenditure for water per household across Australia.  Overall, cost of water in Adelaide and Perth is distinctively low but surpassing the 125-KL threshold saw an exponential surge in price. Contrariwise, the price tag for water in the three remaining metropolises has little or no quota imposed upon.  When consumption in aggregation is below 125 kiloliter, cost of water registers at 0,42$ in Adelaide, Melbourne. However, a two-fold increase in price is applied in Adelaide passing the 125-KL threshold. The equivalent figure in Perth reaches a record high of 1,5% per kiloliters, hence the highest average expenditure for water in this city with 332$.  Apropos of Brisbane and Melbourne, the price tag of water stands at 0,78 and 0.81 respectively while people in Sydney pays nearly one dollar for water. Noticeably, people in Sydney and Melbourne are not prerequisites to pay additional fee for water consumptions. Similarly, a mere 0,03 rise in price is applied in Sydney if total usage surpasses 125 KL. Consequentially, average expenditure for water is lowest in Melbourne with 250$ on average while households in Aladaile, Brisbane and Sydney pay around 310$ for water. 203 words | Introduction: No benchmark  Overview: Mentioned  No correlation mentioned  Body 1: Changes between column 1 and 2  Body 2: No changes between the two column |
| Bao | The table depicts water prices as well as the average expenditure of households in five Australian cities.  Overall, the majority of cities witness a rise in cost when water usage exceeds the 125 kiloliters mark, except for that of Sydney and Melbourne.  Among the five cities, only **Sydney and Melbourne have consistent cost per kiloliter even beyond the 125Kl mark, at $0.98 and $0.78 respectively**. Moreover, the latter have the lowest figure for average expenditure per household at $253  Perth’s and Adelaide’s number for water price, despite ranking the lowest under 125 Kl at $0.42, meet a notable climb up to $1.50 and $1.00 respectively after exceeding the 125Kl point, constituting first and second place. The former also tops the chart in terms of median expenditure at $332.  Brisbane’s figure also faced a rise when reaching the 125Kl ma**rk but to a less significant degree**. Furthermore, its average water bill adds up to $310, placing it in fourth place.

| Son | The provided table elucidates the water expenses of 5 different cities in Australia based on the quantity used.  Overall, aside from Melbourne and Sydney, most cities experience a rise in cost after using more than 125kl of water, especially Perth and Adelaide. Perth also holds the highest average water cost per household, as well as the highest cost when water use is above the threshold.  **Consumption of more than 125kl of water does not increment the cost per kiloliter for Melbourne and Sydney, with both cities having a fixed cost of $0.78 and $0.98 respectively**, ostensibly leading to the former’s position as having the lowest average water bill per household. Whereas Brisbane, while only needing to pay $0.03 when water use exceeds the threshold, has to spend $57 more on average.  On the other hand, Adelaide and Perth, while both having the lowest cost in terms of water usage less than 125kl, surge in cost above the threshold, more than doubling for the former and almost quadrupling for the latter.  (170 words.) | Benchmark mentioned  No correlation  Degree of change may be mentioned |
| Linh Anh | The given table depicts the water expenses for 5 different cities in Australia based on the used amount of water.  Overall, most cities witness a rise in water expenses when passing 125kl except for Melbourne and Sydney whose figures remain stable. Additionally, Melbourne pays the lowest for water per household while an average household in Perth spends the highest on water usage. (gooooood)  **It both costs $0.42 per 1 kilolitre of water in Adelaide and Perth when up to 125 kilolitre is consumed**. However, when the water consumption exceeds 125 kilolitre, Adelaide's data doubles to $1.00 while that of Perth triples to $1.50, making it the most exorbitant among the 5 countries. Similarly, there is a slight increase of $0.03 in the water charges per kilolitre in Brisbane upon passing 125 kilolitre. Meanwhile, Melbourne and Sydney retain the same prices for both under 125 kl and over 125 kl water utilised (for both levels), with 0.78$ and 0.98$ respectively.  With Perth charging the highest in water bills when surpassing the 125 kl mark, each family there spends the biggest number of $332, which is roughly $80 more than Melbourne with only $253 poured into water consumption per household.

| Kiet | The table demonstrates the expenditure on water of five different urban areas in Australia.  Overall, there is an increase in the majority of water cost **upon reaching** 125 KI in the surveyed regions, except for Melbourne and Sydney whose figures remain static. Moreover, Perth has witnessed the most remarkable expansion and outstanding average costs.  A closer inspection of the table indicates that Melbourne and Sydney have a similar pattern. Both cities maintained a constant rate of $0.78 per kiloliter and $0.98 per kiloliter, respectively. Regarding Adelaide and Perth, in spite of the equal initial expenses, Perth's cost surge is 50% greater than that of Adelaide after exceeding 125 KI. Besides, Perth registers the peak average water consumption payment of $332.  As for Brisbane, it is the area with the least change in water cost, commencing at $0.81 per kiloliter, with a marginal 3 cents addition when transcending the 125 KI threshold. Furthermore, it records the second-lowest water cost, being $22 lower than that of Perth.  (163 words) | -Benchmark mentioned (overview)  -No correlation?  -City-based |

The preference of trams despite several demerits

| **Name** | **Summary (100 words)** | **Comments** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Phuc | The given excerpt illustrates the merits of tram compared **to other transportational platforms** and its (their) pitfalls. Tram systems, just like railways, manifest a propitious solution for traffic tailbacks, but more time intensive. Robert Clayton had reportedly considered halting the proliferation of tram systems due to their space-intensive quiddities and inconvenience induced on commuters. Additionally, trams are more **boisterous** as opposed to buses while being deemed implausible in narrow settings. However, the author suggests the widespread construction of tram systems as they are electric-based, hence culminating in little pollution as well as being less costly. Another redeeming feature of tram is that customer comfort is **vouchsafed**, confirmed by Clayton.105 words | Title  No titles.  Yet time-consuming  timetable??? |
| -Vi | The extract elaborates the advantages and disadvantages of using trams as a solution to traffic jams. To commence with the benefits, the tram is environmentally-friendly since it runs on electricity. Furthermore, they are more economical to construct in comparison to railway tracks. However, Robert Clayton mentions that because the tram requires much space, road problems are created, causing inconvenience to the commuters. Another issue is that trams use a fixed route to operate; therefore, it cannot change flexibly as opposed to buses. Nevertheless, although trams are considerably noisier than buses, the author supports the use of trams due to the fact that they are comfortable.  (106 words) | - No title  - Outstanding features compared to other means  - Regarding the benefits  - Compared to  They  Albeit noisier, trams are favoured due to passengers’ comfort, confirms Clayton. |
| Lam | The author suggests building tram systems to address traffic jams and lists the reasons to install one in cities around the world, as well as names its flaws. The writer states that trams are environmentally-friendly as they rely on electricity for fuel. Trams are also more cost effective than railways, though both are needed in most residential areas. Lastly, trams provide fixed routes and are ultimately more comfortable for commuters, albeit noisier than buses *said Robert Clayton*. Some drawbacks of trams include the time-consuming aspect of erecting a system, followed by the lack of room in many narrow streets. (97 words) | No title  -traffic jams->traffic congestion/gridlock  -The author->title  -And justify its preference over other means,despite its….  -time spent on  Inadequate room  Expand on Clayton |
| Son | The extract elucidates the implications of (constructing a ) tram system to combat increasing traffic jams. Apropos of the advantages, trams have little contribution to environmental damage and climate change due to an electric-run system. Other benefits in utilising trams include a cheaper cost for track construction, a fixed routes and generally more comfortable than buses to commuters. However, as confirmed by Robert Clayton, a transport expert, trams necessitate a wide road to operate in, which hinders its ability to be used in cities with narrow streets. Another negative mentioned by the expert is the fact that trams generally produce more noise than buses. Nevertheless, the author still advocates using them.

| Tue | The extract elucidates the pros and cons of the tram system which is a potential solution to urban traffic congestion. Concerning the benefits; firstly, as trams are electricity-based, they are more eco-friendly. Secondly, tram systems are more cost-effective than railway lines. Thirdly, by having an unchanged location, tram tracks are more accessible than buses. The final merit is the comfort offered by trams. Regarding the disadvantages; the first one is the time-consuming construction of a tram system. Additionally, trams need a large space to operate, as stated by a transport expert Robert Clayton. The final demerit is excessive noise created by trams, as opposed to buses. (106 words) | No title  How the merits of  Former  routes/ timetable  However, their drawbacks include …  Also notable is |
| Linh Anh | The given passage provides reasons to construct a tram system as well as including some demerits of tram. Firstly, trams are considered an environmentally-friendly transportation since they operate on electricity. Secondly, trams are also favorable thanks to their economical building cost compared to that of railways. Moreover, trams run on a fixed route, offering greater convenience for commuters(which is more convenient for passengers) despite its excessive noises. Nevertheless, the function of trams is hindered by lack of space in cities. The author justifies this point by stating a historical reference of tram system in Melbourne made by Robert Clayton and comparing it to cities with limited space.

| Bao | The extract depicts the merits and demerits of constructing a tram system within a city. **Firstly, trams are favoured for being environmentally friendly as they operate on electricity, producing minimal pollution**. Furthermore, they are more economical to build than that of railways. Trams are also preferred for their fixed route and comfortability despite being quite noisy compared to buses. However, trams pose a major issue within some cities as they require open and wide spaces to not impede traffic flows. The author then referenced a transport expert, Robert Clayton, to exemplify this point.Moreover, trams are considerably noisier compared to buses. Despite its issues, the author still advocates for the utilisation of trams in cities. (115 words) | * No title * Compare it to other means * Justify the merits , overweighting the demerits |
| Kiet | The extract elucidates the author’s reasons for constructing tram systems to address urban traffic congestions alongside its benefits and drawbacks. The first merit is that trams are environmentally friendly as they are powered by electricity. Moreover, tram tracks are more cost-effective compared to their railway counterparts, though most professionals suggest that metropolitan areas require both. Additionally, trams provide **static** routes and comfortability for their passengers, despite being noisier than buses. However, there exist some notable disadvantages, namely the prodigious time needed to establish a system, as well as the limited vacancy in certain areas with narrow streets.(97 words) | -No title  Grounded on their features  Coupled with … |
| Hao | The excerpt compares the merits and demerits of tram systems to other public transportation. It takes considerable time to construct a tram system. However, trams operating on electricity cause minimal pollution, and tram tracks are significantly more economical to build compared to railway lines. Another major issue with implementing trams is that it requires enough road space for other vehicles to drive around them, as explained by transport expert Robert Clayton. Trams are also significantly noisier than buses. Nevertheless, Robert explains that tram routes are fixed, and trams are more comfortable for passengers, which are important benefits to consider.

| **Bao (1)-(2)** | Many things about myself have changed ever since I got into highschool, both physically and mentally. Physically, **my height h**asn’t changed much but I have gained a considerable **amount of weight**. But the most significant changes occured in my mentality. I feel that I am **much less naive than I was before.** Entering highschool has exposed me to the many facets of life that I was not fully aware of before, such as the depth and complexity of relationships, society and life as a whole. I have made new friends and rivals, been through good and bad times, encountered many challenges along the way. All of this have *helped widen my perspective of the world*, reminding me that there are many who are more talented than myself. While being somewhat depressing, this has become a major motivation for me to move forward and overcome my hardships. | -Not topic front  -Physicality and maturity  -Extrinsic motivation  - Change of context  - Aspect: mindset  - |
| **Phuc 3 -4** | The time span of two years has inevitably induced many transformative changes for me, particularly in the sense of two year of high schools. One of the most epoch-making happenings occurred in this period was my matriculation into Nguyen Du gifted schools, thus moving into Buon Ma Thuot City. Here, i have got first-hand experience of metropolitician lifestyles and deviation from the protective blossom of supportive families. Hence, i witnessed many unforseeable ramifications of autonomous lives as well as the demerits of metropolises including social ills, traffic snarl-ups, rampant polution. However, it must be attested that I do enjoy the therapuetic experience that city offers, hence colosally bostering my social circle and sphere of influence. Here, i got to fully express my idosyncrasies and personality traits. Academic-wise, enrollment in a highly prestigious gift schools, particularly a class purpose-built for adept English speakers is parallel to the nonpareil opportunity to *encounter great individuals who share an innate affinity for English*. Furthermore, I was provided with the accoutrements and pedagogical instructions needed for English proficiency, hence my *participation in the local NEC Team*. All in all, my recent 2 years residing in high schools has seen many metamorphosing changes for me, from a *wide-eyed youngster to a streetwise, clear-minded, all-round individual.* Therefore, I emancipated my vision for the last year in high school with gratification and an erudite sense to fully develop myself. Furthermore, I would aspire to foster my English skills across provinces, speaking, reading, writing and listening. | Changes in lifestyles and academic progress.  Reason: Matriculation and moving into BMT.  → Extrinsic |
| **Vi (5) - (2)** | At a glance, I may seem to have not changed at all compared to when I was a freshman in high school. However, deep within I know that one thing has changed, **my swimming abilities**. Due to the fact that I have not been attending my school’s training sessions, I feel like my skills have deteriorated. Before, accumulating a total of ten medals, I would be the subject of envy for my swimming speed. Now, *I can no longer float above the water and will constantly continue to swallow chlorine once in it.* It feels crappy to be unable to enjoy the waves whenever my family goes to the beach, definitely more so every time I see my sister swimming effortlessly. Therefore, I plan to take up swimming once again and vow to never cut classes again. | - Not topic front (Sport)  - Intrinsic  - Aspect: ability  - No consideration |
| **Son (impromptu), 5-1** | Two years, between secondary and high school, is probably one of my most significant years up to date, not least since I moved to BMT city. **Making new friends, adapting to the bustling lifestyle of the urban experience and learning who I really aspire to be were some of the defining features of this time.** Ever since I studied here, I was able to **r*ealise the extent to which I was missing out on English***. , There are an abundance of people that are better than me that I have to overcome and to this day I still strive to be able to usurp them. Relating to this, the resources and pedagogical knowledge are now more than ever, English or otherwise. With them, **I was able to expedite my learning and achieve a level of enlightenment, albeit a small one.** With this in mind, however, my mindset has largely **remained the same** throughout. I am still a hot-headed, heedless optimist who tries to usurp his own expectations about himself and everyone else. I **still go to great lengths** to be better than anyone else, notwithstanding the mental or physical sacrifices I have to take. I’m just an outdated overture that is now armed with knowledge and ambitions. | Not topic front  mentality , academic |
| **Kiet (2nd: Level/ degree of change)**  **2-2** | Honestly speaking, I was quite a timid and introverted person two years ago. However, the transition to high school marked a turning point in my life, **enhancing my communication skills and newfound confidence, coupled with numerous relationship establishments**. I used to be scared of failure and setbacks and always doubting myself, now, I view them as an *incentive for me to thrive*. I also have a much *more positive outlook on life* after facing numerous challenges during my last two years. I believe that this is a beneficial change for myself compared to the anti-social and frigid person I used to be and now *capable of setting my own goals undeterred by the fear of failure*. I do know that there are plenty of people who are more outstanding than me out there, so it is best to set my own goal to a practicable degree, knowing that excelling truly proficient individuals would be virtually impossible. | -Not topic front(mentality and personality)  - Reason: personality change ->Intrinsic  -Impact: positive outlook and unfazed mindset |
| **Hao (cách 2: degree of change) 2** | There are major differences between my current self and the person I was three years ago. Regarding appearance, I am significantly **leaner** now compared to when I first matriculated at my current highschool. Other than that, my appearance has largely stayed the same. Meanwhile, my personality and thinking-process have gone through a transformation. I am more **mature**, and I have cultivated **a higher stress tolerance**, *able to cope with academic pressure more easily*. Moreover, **my planning skills have got significantly better**. This has allowed *me to discover my passion and goals in life such as what I want to learn at University and what kind of job I want when I grow up.* Accompanied by my newfound self-awareness is **a change in personality**. I am **less gregarious at school now, and dedicate more time to my family.** Overall, my appearance did not change much after 3 years, but I am a significantly more mature person mentality-wise. | * Topic front * Physical and mindset * No reason mentioned * No consideration mentioned |
| **Linh Anh**  **(1-patterns) << 1 or 3** | For self-reflection, I would say I have gone through significant changes during the past 3 years. The most notable change is that I have grown to **become more mature and responsible** for my decisions in life. 3 years ago, I must admit that I always hesitated whenever faced with tough decisions and I was wary of making unbearable mistakes.I felt like I lacked the confidence needed in class; therefore, I passed up on the opportunities to develop myself. As I entered high school, I have stumbled upon much hurdles, thanks to which I learn to place more confidence in myself. I turn into *a more outgoing and sociable girl* *and more open to new relationships* as I met so many friendly people. I suppose it is fine to say that I have the right to be proud of myself for what I have achieved so far. However, I still have room for improvement, which is why I will never stop ameliorating myself. | Not topic front  Personal growth  Intrinsic and extrinsic motivation  Relationship aspects |
| **Tue (1-1)** | **The most noticeable difference is that I am now more mature in various aspects than I was one year ago**. *Academically,* I have acquired a deeper understanding of various subjects, especially in English. This, as a result, can better equip me to pursue my higher education. *Socially*, I have established many social relationships in the high school environment as time goes by, and thus developed a deeper awareness of the intricacies of human interactions. Such experiences can enable me to navigate through personal relationships with more empathy and more emotional intelligence. Overall, the last year has sculpted a more mature and well-rounded version of me, equipped with the acquisition of deeper academic knowledge and interpersonal complexities. | - Topic-front (maturity)  - Extrinsic motivation mentioned  - Academic and social aspect  - No consideration mentioned |
| **Lam(5-2/4)** | I would say that much has changed ever since I got into highschool. Most noticeably has got to be **my maturity**, looking back at it, the me three years ago was somewhat brazen. I was sort of rude to people I did not know and was quite impetuous. Now, *I have grown to respect others and have learned social manners and etiquette*s. One facet that really changed for the better was **my feelings towards studying**. Back then, I used to disdain sitting at my table to research documents and read books;however, more recently *I have become more autodidactic,becoming someone who enjoys the mundane tasks or one that does not mind spending hours contemplating a piece of literature*. Though I still have a long way to go, *I would regard myself as a person with a lot more depth than I previously did.* | Not topic-front ( personal growth and attitude) maturity and feelings.

Inbound tourism

=> Introduction

The given table compares the number in millions of tourists welcomed by nine destinations over two consecutive years 2009 and 2010 alongside their corresponding change rates in percentage terms.

**Data analysis (trends + patterns + ranking)**

France: constant/ unchanged / same - **a record high of** 76

=> always / all-time highest/ consistently higher

=> sustainable development

=> most appealing tourist attraction

=> welcome the greatest number of visitors in both years

Hongkong: the only country to witness a reduction in visitor numbers, correlating to a negative change rate of 11%

=> least favoured destination

=> welcome the lowest …

=> lose …

Others/ remaining categories: increase, yet to varying degrees

=> **Overview**

By and large, all the nations witnessed an increasing popularity in tourism except for France and Hong Kong whose figures also occupied the respective top-notch and bottommost positions.

Overall, bar France’s stability and HongKong’s downward pattern, all the other countries gained prevalence in their inbound tourism.

**Detailed analysis**

A closer inspection of the table indicates **an opposing pattern in France and Hong Kong**. While **the former** registered at a record high of 76 million in both years, reflecting a zero change rate, t**he latter** experienced a rare minus growth all over the board, evidenced by a drop of 11% to 9 million in 2010.

Regarding the US, Spain, the UK and Italy, these countries reported **a marginal increase** of 1 or 2 million in the tourist numbers. Specifically, the US and Italy retained second and fifth position respectively with 67 and 45 million in the final year. Also notable is the switch in ranking between Spain and the UK as the UK’s figure exceeded Spain’s by 1 million to claim the third position with 57 million.

As for the remaining countries, Turkey, China and Germany had the most significant development in inbound tourism, exemplified by an identical rise of 12 million visitors. However, their change rates varied widely depending on their initial level. For example, Turkey claimed 33% in the change rate and shared the same ranking with Italy. Most noticeably, Germany’s figure more than doubled to 23 million in 2010, **equivalent to** an impressive 109%, still being the second lowest.

\*To sum up, it can be inferred from the chart that the rate of change was of no significance as the number of tourists in the second year bore little difference to the final ranking of all the nations surveyed, except for the cases of the UK and Turkey.

| Bao | Lam would like to learn how to work out effectively and gain a physique similar to his 2d idol.  => Lam’s reaction: 😮, very true , i want to become more aesthetic. I want to cosplay in the near future. | It recently dawned on me that my sleep hours are lessening by the day due to the sheer amount of homeworks and classes that I have to attend. This is in no way good for me as *a good rest is extremely important for my physical and mental health*. Moreover, science has also proven that adolescence requires at least 8 hours of sleep per day to ensure good health and growth. Furthermore, **a better study schedule** would be greatly beneficial for my productivity as studying for long hours without adequate rest may lead me to become burnt-out and fall behind my peers. All in all, I am looking for ways to better organise my time to improve my productivity and mental health. | * Intrinsic motivation * No weakness mentioned. |
| Phuc | Bao would learn to bolster his time-management skills and ensure an adequate sleep every night. Bao is suffering from PTSD and sleep deprivation.  => Bao’s reaction: I don't have PTSD tho. Apart from that, it’s true that i want to sleep more than 6 hours everyday :’) | Recently, i have delved into multiple recreational activities, one of which can be **professional gaming**. I am not actually referring to egregious and self-destructive addition but as a **socializing and PR tool.** For example, I found that esport is a fertile ground for many relations and a foundation for a **lucrative career**. However, my skills are reprehensible and I often disheartened my fellow teammates with vanquishing defeat. Therefore, enhancing my gaming skills would essentially be the pancera to all my pitfalls, | No motivation  Disadvantages: Yellow highlight |
| Lam | Phuc wants to enhance his gaming skills. He said that he wants to be the very best that no one ever was.  ⇒ Phuc recation: Everything said is virtually true. | **Health** has always been a priority of mine, and **working out** is an aspect that I pay a reasonable amount of attention to for myriad reasons. Firstly, *I personally believe that training my body is both physically and mentally beneficia*l. Ever since I started working out at home, I have felt much better, my posture has improved, I have much less stress and looking at how my body has grown definitely cheers me up. Secondly, *I have a dream of cosplaying different characters from various TV-shows and mangas, most of which are really muscular and bulky men*. Taking that into account, I have diligently worked to achieve my goals and am getting closer each day. Unfortunately, I have to shift my focus towards my studies which inhibits my training progress, but I will return to getting fit and building muscle as soon as I find the time. In conclusion, although it might seem far-fetched, *I aspire to have the physique of fictional figures*. That is my main motivation to work out, and it has cultivated in me a good mental health, as well as a pleasing appearance . | Intrinsic motives. |
| Vi | Son wants to escape from dangerous situations where he has to swim  ⇒ son: fr fr | The ocean has always held a dear place in my heart. It continues to be my “safe place”, somewhere I can always go to whenever I am in need of support or a sense of clarity. *However, I am embarrassed to say that I cannot swim despite living in close proximity to it*. Many encouraged me to learn swimming once they knew that I did not know how to swim, not aware that I have taken part in many swimming courses and classes during my primary and secondary school years. Therefore, I wish to be able to **swim** in the near future so as to become one with the waves. | - Intrinsic motivation  - No effect  - No determination |
| Son | Hao would like to learn fencing because he wants to hone his strength and precision skills  => Hao: that’s precise and straight to the point | My hometown is situated in a place where water sources are abundant and that the local people are very adept at **the art of swimming**. However, as I had moved out a number of years before I could get a chance to learn it, *I do not know how to swim. Moreover, since my trip back home earlier this year had sparked my interest in the deep blue sea*, I have been training hard to be able to swim. The reasons why I prioritise this over other activities is, in my opinion, the relative importance of it to me. For the aforementioned reasons, and the fact that there lies a myriad of dangerous situations where I have to swim to safety, I have decided to put swimming on the top of my bucket list of things to do by the end of this year. | - Intrinsic motives  - No effects  - No weaknesses B) |
| Hao | Vi would like to learn how to swim because it’s good for job prospects  => Vi’s reaction: True | Provided that I am not constrained by time or money, I would definitely learn **the sport of fencing.** There are multiple reasons why I prefer fencing over other endeavours. Firstly, I practised Taekwondo at an early age but dropped it because I had to focus on school. I want to *reconnect with my martial arts background while learning something new at the same time.* Secondly, I believe fencing is good for the mind and body as it is a sport that exacts rigorous physical and mental training to improve agility and precision. *Taking on fencing would allow me to work on aspects of myself that were neglected in favour of academics*. In short, fencing is an excellent choice for me to further my martial arts pursuits in a new field while also honing my body and mind. | * Intrinsic motives * No effect |
| Kiet | Linh Anh would like to learn crocheting. It is the same as knitting; however, the technique is somewhat different. You use the hook and connect the yarns to make stuffed animals, bags and handmade clothes.  => Lanh’s reaction: yepp, and I’m currently learning it now | As a proud former comic and art advocate, I choose **Art** as my next competence to learn *after having witnessed numerous scenic artworks and realistic human portraits on the Internet*. In other words, I want to *be capable of expressing my own imagination and emotions freely through the paintings*. In addition, I have always had a preference towards drawing since I was young; however, my lack of time would not allow me, up to this point. Therefore, subsequent to my high school years, I would love devote more time into learning how to draw proficiently and produce several piece of arts. From my perspective, it is an amazing skill to have to showcase to my relatives and friends. Furthermore, it may be beneficial in the future as well, what if I got the chance to become a police sketch artist and arrest criminals? | Both intrinsic and extrinsic |
| Linh Anh | Tue would like to learn about general designs. He finds designing very useful especially in his presentations so he wants to learn background design skills and make nice presentations. However, he thinks this will take a lot of time to fully grasp  ⇒ Tue’s reaction: completely true | If there is something that I desperately want to learn about, I would say it is **the art of crochet,** which involves using a hook and yarn to crochet different products. A couple of months ago, I saw *a Tiktok video on very cute crochet products that people made*, and that was when I decided to pick up crocheting one day. **I** *find crocheting really versatile* since I can create a wide range of handmade products such as stuffed animals, bags, key chains and stunning pieces of clothings and gift them to my close friends. Crocheting is also *a good way to relieve stress and anxiety* after a demanding day at school. Since I picked up this as a hobby, I’ve learned to become more resilient and patient because some products require considerable amount of time and effort. Currently, I have only grasp basic techniques on crocheting and create simple products, so in the near future, I am hoping to further develop my skills and productivity to crochet more products | * Extrinsic motivations * Positive effect * No weaknesses mentioned |
| Tue | Kiet would like to learn how to draw. He wants to flex with his friends or families about his beautiful drawings, which can make him more outstanding.  => Kiet’s honest reaction: absolutely true | One thing I would love to develop is **my self-study skill** which seems to be of great importance in this technology-dominated world. *First, Because I am inclined towards social studies, I may not catch up with my friends in scientific subjects who have innate interests for such subjects. Second, the limited time per class can also hinder the teacher’s ability to convey ideas outside and beyond the coursebooks*. Due to the two aforementioned reasons, Should I heavily rely on the teachers and not further my knowledge base by myself, I will run the risk of lagging behind in this ever-changing world where facts and information are constantly revised and updated. This disadvantage can be remedied by an autodidactic method which can enable me to learn at my own pace with the myriad resources available on the Internet. This would not only facilitate the consolidation of my knowledge learned at schools but also the acquisition of new knowledge and skills, which could undoubtedly better equip me to cope with this ever-evolving world. However, I should also ask for the teacher’s guidance so as not to be bewildered at the colossal amount of knowledge available online. | - Topic front  - Both intrinsic and extrinsic reasons  - Effect mentioned  - Support mentioned  - Weakness mentioned  - Plan mentioned |

| --- | --- | --- |
| Hao | The text elucidates why people experience culture shock and the phases they go through. This feeling of estrangement and vexation stems from exposure to foreign culture and surroundings. There are three main stages to culture shock with different emotional responses. Initially, a foreign environment can excite people with novelty and new experiences. After an extended period of stay, feelings of disillusionment and frustration arise as newcomers struggle to grasp the locals’ culture and way of communication. Though hard to overcome, this phase is temporary, and individuals eventually adapt to their new environment. In the final stage, people fully accept their circumstances and can live comfortably in the hitherto unfamiliar community. (110 words) | author??? |
| Bao | The passage discusses the definition, stages and profound effects of culture shock. The term refers to unpleasant feelings resulting from unfamiliarity with environments and practices. Initially, culture shock may go unnoticed, overshadowed by the sense of curiosity and excitement. However, after long periods of time, disorientation and irritation can set in when faced with foreign cultures. This phase, while arduous, is not impossible to overcome as people start to adapt and assimilate into society. The final stage, acceptance, comes with the acknowledgement that a complete understanding of foreign cultures is not needed to be a functional citizen. (97 words) |  |
| Phuc | The given excerpt illustrates the features and different stages of cultural shock. Cultural shock refers to the turmoils and consternation stemming from deviation from the host environment. The pinnacle of cultural shock is manifested in the initial state, honeymoon which is bristled with exuberance and curiosity. However, this phenomenon does not linger but rather is short-lived in long-term exposure. The follow-up stage entails exhaustion and pent-up exasperation as newcomers can not gauge indigenous people’s behaviors. Consequentially, communicational breakdowns added with a sense of homesickness further aggravated this phenomenon. Though surpassing cultural shock can be Herculean, it is not insurmountable as positive attitudes are built up thanks to incremental familiarity. The last phase, acceptance involves the gradual reconciliation of new settings and a decent extent of familiarity. (126 words) |  |
| Lam | The passage presents the features and experiences of culture shock throughout its main stages. Culture shock is an amalgam of the emotions one feels when being in an aberrant environment, which includes anxiety and frustration. During the honeymoon phase, people usually feel ardour when exposed to dissimilar surroundings; however, this is only transient. Disorientation occurs in the following stage, along with depression and homesickness. This stage, albeit of utmost difficulty, is not insurmountable as the syndromes dwindle, and familiarity further develops. **The last stage is when individuals realise that functionality is not dependent on an in-depth understanding of foreign culture. Consequently, acceptance and comfortability are prominent in this process.** (109 words). |  |
| Vi | The extract elucidates culture shock and its three stages of adapting to a new environment. Culture shock is the feeling of unease when experiencing an unfamiliar environment. During the first stage, usually known as the “honeymoon phase”, the individual will feel excited to be in a new setting. However, this period does not last long. In the second stage, they will be in total discomfort since they cannot communicate well with others, leading to stress and fatigue. Finally, the person will come to accept and adapt to their living situation. They understand that being able to integrate completely into an unfamiliar surrounding is not necessary to enjoy the journey.  (109 words) |  |
| Son | The extract provides insights into culture shock alongside its phases and effects on people moving to another community. It is defined by negative emotions associated with travelling to another community, where the social norms, socially or behaviorally are different from that of the individual. Following a period of short-lived excitement and inquisitiveness comes times of distress and frustration as the individual tries to adapt to the surrounding milieu, which mostly affects those who decide to stay in such milieu for extended periods of time. However, if the person is able to acclimate, culture shock will gradually dissipate, and the feeling of distress and anxiety will soothe. (106 words.) |  |
| Tue | The extract elucidates the definition, mechanism and three main stages of culture shock. The phenomenon is associated with the emotion of disorientation when one travels to a new society. This happens due to the differences in cultures between various nations, leading to one’s unfamiliarity with the new environment. Initially, exposure to new surroundings can bring people thrill which; however, fades over time. Then, irritation sets in because of ineffective mutual communication, resulting in depression or homesickness. The final phase is acceptance where individuals have acknowledged that a comprehensive understanding of a culture is inessential and have effectively familiarised themselves with the new atmosphere.  (103 words) |  |
| Kiet | The extract elucidates the definition of cultural shock and its three primary stages. Cultural shock, which comes from the sense of unfamiliarity within the environment, causes depression and anxiety in a person. The first phase, being the early potent stage when someone moves overseas. Subsequently, as the initial enthusiasm fades, frustration and perplexity occur. Communication difficulties contribute to resentment, which accentuate depression and homesickness. However, as time passes, cultural shock diminishes as individuals fully immerse themselves in the alien nation. The eventual stage, known as the acceptance stage, is when travellers become accustomed to the culture and life of the foreign community. (102 words) |  |
| Linh Anh | The passage elaborates on the definition, followed by the descriptions of different stages of culture shock. Typically, culture shock is the phenomenon of anxiety and confusion emerging during one’s exposure to a foreign culture. This experience is classified into 3 main stages. Initially, the “honeymoon” stage occurs when people are intrigued with the brand new surroundings. As time elapses, frustration creeps in due to the cultural differences, which leads to a period of homesickness and depression. This distressing episode is conquered once travelers familiarize themselves in the final acceptance stage. **Acceptance does not require people to grasp the culture inside out, but it emphasizes the comfortability within the unfamiliar place.**(110 words) |  |

**Practice**

Learning lots of languages

A question many people ask is whether it’s possible to learn many different languages, and if so, how to do it. Well, here are some answers.

Any language consists of vocabulary, grammar and sounds. However, the culture of where the language is spoken also contributes towards understanding a language. Therefore, learners need to make sure they have a good understanding of culture as well as language.

Some people wrongly believe that learning many things at the same time will speed up the process when, in fact, it damages it. With this in mind, learning a maximum of two languages at any one time is a good idea. Three languages are too many and will slow down learning. The modern world is obsessed with speed and wanting everything done by tomorrow. This is particularly harmful to language learning – learners need to spend at least two years learning their chosen languages before moving on to the next ones.

While we’re talking about time, only spending a few minutes reading some words from a dictionary each day is not going to get anyone far in learning a language. It’s necessary to have around two hours per day which can be used to focus on language learning.

Some languages are quite similar to others in that they often share vocabulary and grammar, for example, and this can cause confusion. Choosing two languages that are very different from each other is advisable. Learning Spanish and Italian at the same time, for example, is not a good approach because they’re too alike. Instead, one way of helping learning is to choose an ‘easy’ language and a relatively ‘difficult’ one. By ‘easy’, I mean one that’s related to a language you already know, whereas the ‘difficult’ one might be totally unlike anything you’ve learned before. Giving the more ‘difficult’ language about 75 percent of study time, and the ‘easy’ one about 25 per cent should be about right.

And finally, to learn anything well, it has to be practised regularly, so be sure to study the languages every day. Good luck!

**Trams**

If you live in a city, you’re likely to spend many hours each year sitting in **traffic jams**. This can be a major problem, and one way of tackling it is to encourage people to use cars less by improving **public transport.** Cities worldwide are trying to provide better bus and train services, but many also want to extend their tram systems or introduce new ones. However, as with railways, constructing a tram system takes considerable time. So, why build a tram system?

One important point is that trams cause very little pollution because they **run on electricity**. At a time when environmental damage and climate change are serious issues, this is a major consideration. Another clear benefit is that tram tracks are cheaper to build than railway lines, although most experts agree that towns and cities need railways and underground systems as well.

Many cities around the world have had trams since the 19th century. In the Australian city of Melbourne, for example, they were first introduced in 1884, and there are now 24 tram routes and over 250 kilometres of track in the city. Robert Clayton, a Melbourne transport expert, says that the city council considered closing the system in the 1980s. ‘But fortunately, they dropped those plans,’ says Clayton. ‘We’re lucky. Melbourne streets are mostly wide and we don’t have the problem which some cities with narrow streets have. In those places, other traffic gets stuck behind trams – there’s not enough space to drive around them.’

Clayton explains that because tram tracks are fixed, people know that a tram route will never change. ‘It’s not the same with buses,’ he says. ‘Their routes get changed from time to time for various reasons. And although trams are noisier than buses, people here say they’re more comfortable for passengers to ride in. **After all, isn’t that one of the most important things?’**

=> justify

=> more merits than demerits

| Name | One thing I have got to know about my friend | Reflections/ Comments | Ask your teacher questions |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Khanh Vi | Son is a friend I just got to know recently because he studies in a different school. I found him to be quite extraverted, fun to talk to and learn from. | Son: fr fr | Why did you choose to go abroad? |
| Sy Son | Tue is good at listening and writing, since he listens to bbc everyday and practices writing very much. He also like vietnamese food, not least street vendors | Tue : I’m not that good at listening and writing. 🥲 | messi or ronando |
| Do Tue | Vi used to live in Australia when she was a kid. Now she is currently living in BMT city. She loves playing basketball. She is also partial to reading comic books. Her weakness is her writing skill. | Oh I don’t really like playing basketball or any sports in general  Hao: why are you bald? | What’s your favourite Vietnamese food? |
| An Phuc | Kiet is my bestmate, he is a genuine friend who always aid me in my studying. Kiet is quite able-bodied and engage in various recreation activities such as football and volleyball. To elucidate, in his previous year in a private school, Kiet actually obtained the leading positions in the school football leagues. Moreover, he also excels at intellectual activities such as chess and videogaming. Last, Kiet is essentially a connoisseur in English. He is a core and youngest member of the NEC team. To sum up, i fell very blessed to have Kiet as my sidekicks and fellow companion in an arduous journey named NEC. | To be honest, some of the mentioned activities are pretty much made up and overexaggerated. For instance, I never excelled at football 🙁H.  son 👍 | Where are you currently living? What is your marital status at the moment, do you have any kids? |
| Minh Kiet | Phuc is an dependent person, he lives in the dormitory and always goes to school late. However, he is truly a good person and someone to rely on. For example, during our biology tests, he helped me on studying for the test.  Moreover, he adores playing video games, but at a certain degree only. He usually overexaggerate stuff, like how he described me above. | → It is actually the other way around, kiet help but my score was higher than him 😂😂😂. | What do you think about the 2024 USA presidential election?  What do you think about Australia? |
| Duc Bao | Hao likes barbecue noodles, and he wishes to follow economics. His hometown is a traditional village. He comes back to his hometown at least once a year. He has a twin brother studying the same class who wants to study overseas. Hao is interested in foreign history and is currently studying Japanese. | That’s true, I don’t study Japanese bro, only on Duolingo.    (Bao)That is still learning japanese :))) wdym | If i asked you to recommend me a book what would say? :D  The Hate U Give  Thank you for your recommendations, i will check them out.  What kind of movie or culture are you most interested in? :O |
| Nhat Hao | Bao wants to work in IT, his family came from suburban Hanoi but it’s been over 10 years since they came there. He now has more relatives in HCM than in Hanoi. If he had to choose, he would choose to live in HMCC. His brother is currently studying electronics at the polytechnic academy in HCM. | Are you more interested in my family than me or smth :))’. But all of it is correct  (Lam):Bao’s resemblance to his brother is almost uncanny  (Bao): Would be a problem if i didn't | What university did you go to?  ULIS |
| Linh Anh | Lam likes reading manga in his free time, recently he has been taking up light novels as well. He is quite a stoic person and he loves doing things that suits his liking and satisfaction. He’s also quite a dramatic person (overdramatic in my opinion) He thinks a good friend needs to help each other to improve and become a better person as a whole. A good friend has to point out his mistakes. And he is also willing to support and emphathize with his friends too. | Yes i do like reading manga and comics, some of my favorites are jujutsu kaizen and chainsaw man. | How long have you been teaching abroad?  What are the tips that you recommend to people who want to study abroad? (like me) :>  Okayy thank god I know how to cook :D  How do you feel about Australia, is it a beautiful and picturesque country like those TV shows describe?  Do you miss Vietnam sometimes and how often do you travel back to Vietnam?  Awww |
| Ngoc Lam | Linh Anh sometimes plays basketball. She likes playing gacha games. She describes herself as a shy and awkward person. She thinks that a good friend should be able to empathise, and should be the emotional support for people around them. She enjoys traditional Vietnamese food | Linh Anh: No comment, the fact that recently I have been playing less gacha games though :”> | What is your opinion on japanese culture and more particularly on animated cartoons.  What are the reasons that bring you to Australia and are you living there or are you just working?  What time is it in Australia now? |

| Name | Paragraph writing | Comments/ Analysis |

| Hao | I believe my most recent achievement is **having survived another week of school**, *thereby having the weekend to catch up on homework and learn what I actually enjoy*. I believe you have to find happiness in the mundane, putting all you’ve got into doing simple tasks or jobs is an achievement in and of itself. A few days off is the reward for doing one week’s worth of classwork dutifully. I don’t condone the “live for the weekends” mindset, but I do believe we have to work hard to achieve what we want in life, and have to accept that the weekends are well-earned rewards.  -> Linh Anh: The text depicts the author’s recent achievement at school and provides reasons and consideration for it | Aspect: academic/everyday life  Topic front  Explanation mentioned  Intrinsic motivation mentioned: to achieve  Effect mentioned (Instant effect. Aspect: self-fulfilment ) |
| Linh Anh | One of my most recent achievement that I’m really proud of is the fact that I get to **attend this online class as one of the most gifted English students in my province.** To be able to get into the National English team is like a dream come true for me, not even in my wildest dream would I think I could get into the team TvT, there are no words I can use to describe my *surprise and happiness* then. Although it was quite a close call, I’m glad that I made it. In the team I’ve been trying my best to *practice my writing, reading and most importantly, listening and my vocabulary range,* since those two skills have always been my weaknesses. I can see that *I’ve made some progress*, but I’m still nowhere near as good as my peers so perhaps I will have to try harder to catch up.  Hao: The text elucidates the author’s recent achievement of getting into the NEC team and misgivings about the opportunity. | Academic  Topic front  No reason mentioned  Instant effect: aspect: emotion  Academic effect |
| Vi | I have always done terribly in Chemistry so getting above a 6 in my mid-term exam was something I regarded as an amazing feat that I never could hope to achieve. So you can imagine my surprise when I found out that I **passed my exam with a 7.5** no less, considering that I got a 2 in my previous test. I definitely consider it as a stroke of luck though, since I still do not understand a thing about Chemistry to this day.

| Lam | I rarely really do anything that,in my opinion, is worth being called an achievement. However, recently, I have **made progress in writing essays.** Since my writing skills have always been subpar, it can be quite demoralising to know that i am not on the same level as my peers, but in the past month or so *i have made improvements* and to me that is a ver*y rewarding experience*. Another thing that i would say i am quite pleased to be able to have is **the ability to sit through a text-only book**, which previously would have been very challenging for me, considering my attention span.

| Phuc | Throughout my life, I have been given the opportunity to witness many epoch-making, radical transformatations. **However, recently my most pronounced achivement was getting into the NEC team of Nguyen Du.** Getting into the team was the best thing that has happened to me, albeit being ascribed partly to luck and my execrable handwriting. The period following the filtering exame however was rife with emotional turmoil and consternation. For fear of failing to pass would be parallel to the **futility** of all my efforts. *Moreover, having jeopardized all my life for English, a departure from mainstream education would only spell doom for me. However, I managed to scrape through the exam. My feeling was quite* ***poignant*** *actually, following a sense of* ***relief*** *then comes the prelimanry feelings between the exams. Therefore in the following months, i would probably assume a new of* ***responsibility*** *for English*  *Bao:* This passage elaborates on the writer’s recent achievement in joining the NEC and the positive effects it had on the author. | Aspect: Academics  Topic front:  Motivation: Not given  Academic achievments and therapuetic upshots  → Long-term sense of responsibility  Concession: Purple highlight  Countervailing Hypothethesis (reductio ad absurdum): Blue highlight |
| Bao | One of my most recent achievements has to be that I **got a near perfect score in the mid-term Physics examination yesterday, a 9.7 to be exact**. I am *very proud* of this result due to the fact that I had to prepare for other classes and exams as well so I didn't have much time to review my lessons . However, this result has also *troubled me quite a bit* as the question that i got wrong was not particularly difficult and I had made the same mistake before :<.

| Son | One of my more recent achievements was **second place in the Vietnamese equivalent of science fair**, but on a provincial level. Involving 185 teams and over 350 competitors, me and my friend Almond are lucky to be one of 14 teams that managed to be almost on the top, only missing a few points from getting first place. I went to this competition because she wanted a translator as well as a companion to attend this fair. *Alas, we shared the price money for reaching 2nd place; it is not much though*  Kiet: The extract delineates the author’s experience and the incentive of their participation in a science fair. | - Academic  -Topic front (probably)  - Extrinsic motive (wants to help almond get her prize)  - Short-term ($), relationship-related effects (better friendship with almond)  - no emotion  - no mentioned concession (we worked very hard) |
| Tue | I want to tell you guys about **my chance to get into the NEC team, which is one of the things I’m proudest of**. I used to be a very ordinary student in my class last year. I was so self-conscious about my skills at that time because my classmates showed a much better performance than me. This instilled in me a tendency to undermine my abilities, and a way of pessimistic thinking that I cannot catch up with my peers. **However, I always think of myself as an ambitious person who will try his best to pursue or achieve his goals**. Over time, I gradually honed my skills step by step, which obviously enabled me to enter the NEC team. *In hindsight, I would say I’m very grateful that I had exerted myself at that time.*  Son: the text recounts the author’s gratefulness and motivation about being a member of the NEC team | * Academic achievement * Topic front * Intrinsic motivation * Instant effect :   Academic -> Emotions (fortitude)   * No consideration mentioned |
| Kiet | One obvious achievement is of course, **getting into the team to compete for the National English Competition**. However, last year, I managed to get **second place in the provincial English competition**, as well as **first place among the 10th graders in 10/3 (somewhat similar to 30/4 of HCMC).** I nearly lost the chance to be in the NEC qualifying team because of my recklessness in time-management and self-care, leading to a poor result in the first round. Nonetheless, I managed to retrieve my form and *secured 1st place in the school’s qualifiers in the 2nd round.* Besides that, I have also acquired **2 bronze chess medals** by competing against my chess club members and the students of my school.

Culture shock is the feeling of uncertainty, confusion, or anxiety that people experience when visiting, doing business in, or living in a society that is different from their own. Social norms can vary significantly across countries and regions. Culture shock can arise from an individual's unfamiliarity with local customs, language, and acceptable behavior.

Culture shock is usually most intense at the beginning of a stay abroad - but in a good way. At first, people are usually thrilled to be in their new environment, and they see it as an adventure. If someone is on a short stay, this initial excitement may define the whole experience. However, if someone has moved to the new locale on a long-term basis, this "honeymoon" phase will eventually end.

As the initial glee of being in a new environment wears off, people grow increasingly irritated and disoriented. Fatigue sets in with the **misunderstanding** of others' actions or conversation, ways of doing or operating things, habits: all the little other nuances of speech, appearance, and behavior that are instinctively understood at home.

The **inability to effectively communicate**—to interpret what others mean and to make oneself understood—is usually the prime source of frustration. This, the most difficult period of culture shock, is when depression or homesickness and longing for the familiar and comfortable become most prominent.

Culture shock can be tough to overcome, but the syndrome often does dissipate over time. As a traveler becomes more familiar with a place, the people, customs, food, and language become more **palatable and comfortable**. Navigation of surroundings gets easier. Friends are made. And everything gets a little more comfortable.

Following this period of adjustment comes the final stage of culture shock: acceptance. Acceptance doesn’t mean that new cultures or their values, beliefs, and attitudes are completely understood. Rather, it signifies a realisation that complete understanding isn’t necessary to function and thrive in the new surroundings. **During the acceptance stage, travellers have gained the familiarity they need to feel more comfortable with life in a foreign society.**
