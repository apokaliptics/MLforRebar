**Task 1**: The given graph shows the nitrogen oxide emissions produced by four vehicles (no specific time period). Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features and make comparisons where relevant.

The given chart demonstrates the nitrogen oxide emissions from four vehicles including Diesel Car, Petrol Car, Lorries and Buses.

As can be seen from the paragraph, at speed increases, the emitted nitrogen oxide from Diesel Car increases slightly, meanwhile, the figure for Petrol Car undergoes a slightly downward trend. Nonetheless, Lorries and Busses remain stable regardless of their speed.

The nitrogen oxide emissions from Diesel Car falls sharply from approximately 42 g/km to around 30 g/km before soaring noticeably and hitting the highest point of the whole chart. The time period witnessed a halving of Petrol Car emission from 30 g/km to 15g/km, except for a minor increase for the remaining speed.

Besides the fluctuation of the two proportions of nitrogen oxide emissions of Diesel Car and Petrol Car, the figure of Lorries and Buses remain stable, at around 10 g/km for both.

**Task 2:** Some believe that advances in technology are increasing the gap between rich and poor while others think the opposite is happening. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

In contemporary society, technological advancements become fundamental needs in our society. And the debate over whether it will increase the rich and poor discrepancy or the opposite is happening, still exists. This essay will detail both viewpoints and give my own opinion

On the one hand, there are several convincing reasons why advances in technology contribute to the rise in the rich and poor gap. The key factor is the fact that technological advancement is now replacing various works. Indeed, labour works, namely high-rise window cleaners, logging and fishing, despite the intensity and risky nature, their workers receive little compensation. Additionally, the main workforce of these professions is the low-income population/ the underprivileged. Evidently, in this day and age, technological advancements, including robots and AI, can substitute humans to do these tasks further effectively. Meanwhile, intellectual occupations cannot be replaced by any technological advancements. Besides that, they play a vital role in fostering the economic growth and the future development of society in the long run. Consequently, this margin can force the discrepancy between the poor and rich significantly.

On the other hand, proponents of the opposite sides of this trend argue there are evident merits in many aspects. To begin with, technology can bridge the gap between different classes. Thanks to technological advancements, non profit organizations and governments can support the poor with numerous subsidy raising campaigns and volunteering programmes. For instance, “Breeding”- online campaign to raise the morality of Internet users to support the poor childrens in remote areas in the Southern of VietNam, creates opportunities for them to go to school and have a better life. In brevity, with the support of the advances of technology, the underprivileged can receive support from the upper classes to enhance their backgrounds, leading to reduction in the rich and poor discrepancy.

In conclusion, both viewpoints have merits. Accordingly, a comprehensive approach is the combination of support policies from the government, as well as the moral campaigns, which foster the long-term benefits.

1. In contemporary society, technology is constantly being renovated at a rapid pace. Several individuals contend that these technological innovations are widening the disparity between the affluent and the impoverished, while others believe that it is narrowing the discrepancy in wealth. In this essay, I will discuss both viewpoints and present my stance on the matter with pertinent examples to substantiate it.

On the one hand, technology undoubtedly benefits individuals with sufficient resources. To commence with, advanced technological gadgets are often exorbitant and require significant capital investment. For instance, the Apple Vision Pro, a novel technological innovation from Apple, despite having numerous captivating and revolutionising features, its outrageous price tag prohibits a myriad of users from purchasing and testing out the product. Furthermore, technological advancements can foster job displacement, particularly in the manual labour industries. To elucidate, automated machinery and artificial intelligence, a product of the innovative human brain, can replace low-skilled occupations and repetitive tasks, incurring a loss of profession for various individuals unable to adapt to the transforming job market.

On the other hand, proponents of the view that technology narrows the gap argue that it democratises access to information, education, and opportunities. Initially, the internet, one of humanity’s most paramount inventions, has made the search for information and learning more accessible to individuals regardless of their backgrounds. To explicate, people from distant regions with inadequate educational opportunities can invest in a portable computer or a smartphone to access the limitless source of information on the Internet. Accordingly, they can develop personal skills and acquire specialised knowledge to compete in a competitive job market, surpassing poverty. Moreover, the revolutionised methods of communication have enabled several impoverished families to seek opportunities and reach audiences at a larger scale. One prime example is online selling, with a rudimentary smartphone, one can initiate their own business online, merchandising handmade items to generate income.

From my perspective, technology is a double-edged sword. While it can indeed exacerbate inequality if its benefits are concentrated among the wealthy, it can also be a powerful tool for reducing poverty and promoting equality if it is made accessible to all. Hence, it is imperative for authorities and global technological giants to implement suitable measures to maximise the potential merits of technological advances.

In conclusion, the ramifications of technology on social and economic inequality are multifaceted. When utilised wisely and equally, novel technological gadgets can produce fruitful results for both the rich and the poor, effectively narrowing the gap between the classes. However, without careful consideration and inclusive policies, technology can also exacerbate the disparity between people of all classes, primarily benefiting those with existing resources while leaving others behind.

2. Furthermore, numerous zoos are actively involved in conservation efforts. By way of clarification, several zoos are participating in breeding programs for endangered species, helping to increase population numbers and genetic diversity. For instance, breeding programmes from zoos to sustain the population of the endangered giant pandas have been largely successful. In addition, several zoos also collaborate with global conservation organisations to protect natural habitats and support wildlife reserves. In brevity, by initiating breeding programmes and cooperating with trustworthy conservation associations, zoos are instrumental in protecting living creatures at risk of vanishing.

**Part 3:**

1. What advantages can tourism bring to a city?

imo, numerous -> financial aspect, undeniable that tourism foster growth through the visitors as well as some (pause), besides financial benefits -> crucial for the nation to introduce to foreigners as well as others about their cultural diversity -> beautiful views

2. Why do some young people like to live in cities?

perspective -> benefits cities bring to young people -> the young need the opportunity to develop, career opportunities, moreover, cities meet demands from entertainment to living standards -> cities optimal choice for ppl whats to develop future careers.

3. Do most elderly people live in the city or in the countryside?

quite hard to clarify whether live in city or the (coherence..) more remote areas, reasons: initially, some elderly -> connect to the young generation -> prefer cities because of activities and innovations of modern cities, while the rest tend to prefer the peaceful life in the more remote areas that cities can not bring to them.

4. Do you think well-developed tourism will have negative effects on local people?

some noticeable disadvantages -> first, tv? attract tourists -> noisy all the time -> although can bring the atmosphere of the city -> disturb local residents the time they need to …? -> living standard in those cities -> high -> impact local residents -> esp those without good background conditions.

Bill Gates funding - the biggest nonprofit funding organization of the millionaire Bill Gates, is an appealing evidence for the

Human well-being policies, subsidies, volunteering organizations from the governments and the wealth-> positive effect on … ex: bill gates funding, wealth-> instead of asset race-> contribute to the nonprofit benefits…

The poor cannot have enough background condition-> have the op to access to the common\* innovations, why the rest can addapt-> the unbalance in mindset, developed conditions.

- salary, AL, labour work ( gruelling and… ), fact, AA can substitute, even far more efficient., intellectual work, ex: scientist, developer control these robots, tech ad,.. -> provide practical benefits for sc-> appropriate salary,

Writing:

**Task 1:** The table below shows population figures for four countries for 2003 and projected figures for 2025 and 2050. Summarize the information by selecting and reporting the main features, and make a comparison where relevant.

*(image removed)*

The given chart demonstrates information about the population figures for four countries for 2003 and projected figures for 2025 and 2050.

As can be seen from the chart, it is evident that the population of Argentina, Indonesia and Republic of Korea are forecasted to increase during the 47 years period, whereas the figure of Italy will undergo a dramatic decrease.

Regarding Argentina, the 2003’s populations recorded 34 million peoples, which simultaneously predicted to soar significantly to 14 millions people in both time periods. Likewise, regarding Indonesia, the 22 years period and 25 years period share the same gap of populations, with approximately 37 million peoples, in comparison with 238 million people of 2003. Likewise, in Indonesia, the population increased and is expected to rise by approximately 37 million over both the 22-year and 25-year periods, relative to a total population of 238 million in 2003. With respect to Italy, from 2003 to 2025, there was a significant downward trend in the population of this country from 54 million people to 47 million people, and this figure is continuously predicted to drop slightly by 2 million people.

Besides the inconsistent trend of three regions, the population of Republic of Korea just rose noticeably from 48 million people to 52 million people and is forecasted to remain unchanged in the remaining time period.

**Task 2:** Crime is a big problem in the world, and nothing can be done to prevent it. To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give your own opinion.

In contemporary society, the alarming rise of crimes has become a prominent issue, and there is a belief that nothing can prevent these social evils. This essay will explore the reasons why I disagree with this statement.

There are several convincing methods to tackle high crime rates for the government. To begin with, governments can implement support policies and subsidies such as scholarships and educational campaigns for the poor to promote them to go to school. Take Finland as a prime example of a nation's system successfully providing high living standards and minor crime rates, since Finland publishes numerous job and study opportunities for childrens and the poor, the gap of intellectual level can be reduced. Obviously, these strategies can promote the balance of Per Capital Income and mitigate the rich and poor discrepancy, which contribute to the recession of crime rates in the long run. Additionally, assisting the prisoners as well as their victim-related relationships is crucial for the reduction of crime rates. In fact, they deserve an appropriate chance to recognize a new future for their life, and to prevent them from causing more unfortunate consequences, governments should have the responsibility to help them through subsidies and rehabilitation for the criminals.

Furthermore, it is evident that the positive transformation of crime rates can be done with the support of the whole society. Initially, it is undeniable that school and family are the fundamental factors breeding and shaping the characteristics of every person. In detail, the companionship between these neutrons of society with their children plays a vital role in raising the awareness of the necessity of study and the negative impacts of crime.

In conclusion, admittedly, the alarming situation of crime rates cause challenges for the whole society in the long-term future, however, there are various hopeful ways to mitigate this prominent issue within the contribution of the whole society.

Proponents: general

since you already disagreed there are two main paths you can go:

- Fully disagreeing with the question:

+ 2 body paragraphs all disagreeing and concluding with your negative opinion

OR

+ 3 body paragraphs:

1. listing why proponents believe that nothing can be done to prevent crime

2. strictly list why crime rate can be reduced

3. your opinion -> counterargument for the first paragraph of the question's proponents.

### reference writing (2 body totally disagreeing):

In contemporary society, crime rates are burgeoning in certain parts of the world. Proponents believe that no action can be taken to impede these criminal activities. From my perspective, I totally disagree with this statement, and this essay will provide pertinent illustrations to substantiate my view.

While entirely eliminating crime may be implausible, effective measures exist to reduce it substantially. To commence with, it is imperative to address the root factors breeding criminality. To explicate, circumstantial aspects, essentially inadequate education and poverty, have been the prime driving forces of crime. Specifically, circumstantial factors such as inadequate education and poverty have been prime driving forces behind crime. By investing in accessible education and social programmes, the number of people resorting to criminal activities out of desperation will be significantly reduced.

Furthermore, there should be an emphasis placed on rehabilitation to lower the rate of recidivism. Current penitentiaries may have been able to punish perpetrators of crime; however, most neglect the importance of criminals to redeem themselves. By providing incentives for ex-prisoners to reintegrate into the community, namely vocational training, coupled with a reduction of discrimination against ex-offenders, former criminals can successfully incorporate themselves back into society. For instance, Bastoy Prison in Norway offers prisoners numerous vocational educational opportunities, along with a comfortable living standard. Consequently, the recidivism rate of previous offenders originating from this prison is incredibly lower than countless other prisons in Europe.

In conclusion, although crime is a compelling issue worldwide, I firmly disagree that it is impossible to inhibit the crime rate. By implementing feasible measures, mainly addressing the root factors and successful rehabilitation, the crime rate can be significantly diminished.

### **To-do list tomorrow (13/03/2025):**

Write the body of these two questions, make sure to correct your grammar properly and manage your time effectively (less than 15 minutes per body)

1. Some people think that the increasing use of computers and mobile phones for communication has a negative effect on young people’s reading and writing skills. Do you agree or disagree?

2. Some children spend hours every day on their smartphones. Why is this the case? Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?

**1**. On the one hand, proponents of the disadvantages of electronic devices argue that demerits are evident in the decline in writing and reading skills. Ubiquitous online platforms - Chat GPT, Quilbot, served as prime examples for giving outcomes for their questions and requirements immediately. Since these advantages can optimize user's time for looking up information through simple steps instead of spending hours and hours on reference books, or other physical resources, they can easily become passive and become fully dependent on these technological advancements. Consequently, over-utilizing these electronic devices can lead to the reduction in writing and reading skills in the long run.

On the other hand, there are convincing reasons for the positive statements of this trend. It is controversial that books, namely ancient ones, play a vital role in providing important details, which the Internet can not showcase and explain for their users comprehensively. Furthermore, while using electronic devices frequently, there are various people who don’t have great texting skills, accordingly, noting significant details on hands is more effective than texting on Internet platforms. In addition, the green light on the screen, leading to numerous eye diseases, can long-term harm to their user’s health. By this way, reading and writing skills are irreplaceable by any alternatives.

2. Some children spend hours every day on their smartphones. Why is this the case? Do you think this is a positive or a negative development?

Numerous effective functions-> Ubiquitous online platforms - Chat GPT, Quilbot, served as prime examples for adapting user’s requirements and giving answers for their study task immediately. Additionally, not only study benefits but smartphones can help childrens to entertain themselves by various games platforms and social media. In detail, game help children's relieve stress and anxious after a long tiring day and quickie replenish energy for another tasks, whereas social media able to adapt their demands on connection to their friends, sharing adorable memories, boosting fame on the Internet etc

On the one hand, proponents of the huge proportion of teenage users of smartphones argue that its merits are evident in . In this technology era, since people need opportunity for future occupations and promotion, it is essential for them to access this backbone of modern society at adolescence, and even young adulthood. In detail, the flexibility of smartphones with a wide range of educational platforms, which help them to navigate online resources to enhance their study productivity and self-independence, forming their intellectual level suitable for trends in social development. Urgent circumstances -> safety -> apps: navigation gps -> keep track even they don’t at the same place.

On the other hand, there are convincing reasons for the negative effect of this electronic devices for children. The alarming rise of the smartphone addictions due to video games and fully dependent on social media is the prominent issue of the modern society. In detail, this “phenomenon” have numerous negative impacts on children, namely psychological disorders, sedentary lifestyles and eye-sightedness. Furthermore, regarding social media young age users, they can be high risk at becoming the center victims of social violence, leading to unforeseen consequences, even suicide ones.

Some people say that television is useful for education, while others say it is useful only for entertainment. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.

There are convincing reasons to explain why the majority believe in the effectiveness of television in education. To begin with, . In specific, national channels provide numerous updated recent situations of the whole word; whereas, Ted- Ed, The Learning Channel - prime examples of educational programmes, conveying useful self-help lessons along with educational methods for the audiences. Incontrovertible, these channels and programmes are essential for enhancing self-independence in study besides compulsory curriculums and enhancing people’s knowledge enlargement.

Proponents of the exclusive benefits of television-recreation argue that appealing reasons is evident in certain aspects. Initially, programming schedule play a crucial role in the channel choice of viewers. Indeed, TV channels manage systems have a tendency to disseminate entertainment-related features in the break time of the majority of audiences, based on their annual viewers preference charts. Specifically, users can easily entertain themself after a long tiring day with various films and amusement programmes. Moreover, the era of technological advancements, typically television, witnesses a significantly upward trend of the TV addiction rate, especially the young. This data is evidently reflected the high demand of enjoyment among human, which TV can easily adapted.
