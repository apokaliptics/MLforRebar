Theme 1: Animals

Topic 1: **Some people think that keeping pets is good for children, while others think it is dangerous and unhealthy for them. Which viewpoint do you agree with?**

Several individuals believe that having pets is beneficial for youngsters, whereas some others think that pets pose risks to the young’s well-being. From my perspective, I concur with the former view and this essay will provide pertinent illustrations to substantiate my view.

It is incontrovertible that pets can play a crucial part in a child’s emotional development. To commence with, the companionship of a pet can teach the youth about empathy, responsibility and nurturing. To elucidate, activities involved in taking care of a pet, namely feeding and showering a pet instil a sense of responsibility among children. In addition, pets can be considered as their best friends, becoming a source of comfort in difficult times. This acquaintanceship can be especially beneficial for children struggling with constant pressure and loneliness.

Furthermore, pets can induce children to become more physically active. To elaborate, children can engage in playtime activities with their pets, including walking, running or playing fetch. For instance, dogs, which are known to be significantly energetic animals, require extensive outdoor playtime to satisfy their boundless exuberance. Accordingly, youngsters will incorporate such activities into their daily routine, fostering a healthy lifestyle at an early age.

In conclusion, while there exist some concerns about potential risks from pets, possibly the hostility and diseases these animals may carry, I believe that the merits of pet ownership from young people far overshadow these disadvantages. With proper supervision, such negative points can be neglected, while still retaining both psychiatric and physical benefits for youngsters. In brevity, the advantages of pet ownership for children are indubitably apparent, outstripping potential concerns.

Topic 2: **Animals should not be used for the benefit of human beings unless there is evidence that the animals do not suffer in any way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the statement?**

The ethical treatment of animals has become a significant concern in contemporary society, numerous individuals believe that the use of animals for human purposes is only justified if the animals are not experiencing any suffering. From my perspective, I partially agree with the statement and this essay will provide pertinent illustrations to substantiate my view.

To commence with, it is undeniable that animals are sentient beings and can experience pain and suffering. In other words, hurting animals is similar to hurting an actual human. Therefore, it is imperative that there are certain regulations concerning the welfare of animals used for human benefits. =>DÀI DÒNG Therefore, regulations concerning the welfare of animals used for human benefit are imperative For instance, numerous policies have been placed in farms to ensure that cattles and poultry have adequate space and access to food and water. =>CHECK​​ For instance, numerous policies have been implemented on farms to ensure that cattle and poultry have adequate space, food, and water

However, the absolute requirement that animals should not suffer in any way is almost impossible to guarantee. Even with advanced technologies and stringent regulations, some level of discomfort or stress is often unavoidable. In fact, in medical research, animal testing has played a crucial role in developing life-saving treatments for both humans and animals. =>In fact, animal testing has played a crucial role in developing life-saving treatments for both humans and animals in medical research. One prime example is insulin, a crucial treatment for diabetes, was the product of experimenting on dogs. =?One prime example is insulin, a crucial treatment for diabetes, which was developed through experiments on dogs While they suffered pain initially, the end product ultimately saved countless animals and humans from diabetes.

In conclusion, while it is essential to entirely remove the pain from using animals for the sake of humanity, it is not entirely practical at present. Personally, I believe that we should strive to minimise the pain inflicted on other species while still using them for our own well-being. In essence, animals are still crucial in enhancing human lives, although discomforts from animals should be reduced.

**1. Task Response (Score: 7,0)**The essay addresses the prompt adequately by discussing both sides of the argument (ethical treatment of animals and their use for human purposes). The position is clearly stated, and examples are provided to support the writer's view.

**2. Coherence and Cohesion (Score: 7.0)**The essay is well-organized with clear progression of ideas. Each paragraph focuses on a distinct aspect of the argument, using cohesive devices (e.g., transition words) effectively to connect ideas within and between paragraphs.

**3. Lexical Resource (Score: 7.0)**There is a good range of vocabulary used appropriately throughout the essay. Key terms related to animal welfare and ethics are well-chosen and contribute to the clarity and precision of the argument.

**4. Grammatical Range and Accuracy (Score: 7,0)**While there are some grammatical errors and occasional awkward phrasing, the overall grammar is mostly accurate. Complex structures are attempted, though some errors in subject-verb agreement and word choice could be noted.

Topic 3: **Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree with this point of view? Why or why not?**

The debate over whether human needs for farmland, housing, and industry should take precedence over conserving land for endangered animals is a complex and contentious issue. Personally, I partially agree with the statement and this essay will provide pertinent illustrations to substantiate my view.

To commence with, it is apparent that biodiversity is essential for the health of our planet. In other words, certain endangered animals may play specific roles in their ecosystems, contributing to the balance and functionality of these environments. Hence, the disappearance of such species can have a cascading effect. For example, various species of sea turtles, which are increasingly endangered, are crucial for the maintenance of coral reefs and transporting nutrients from the ocean to coastal dunes and beaches. Their deprivation could be potentially detrimental to numerous other species.

On the other hand, the development of human life cannot be overlooked. Initially, the exponential growth of human population is indisputably immense, which is followed by the increased demand for accommodation, agricultural and industrial land. =>Initially, the exponential growth of the human population is indisputably immense, leading to an increased demand for accommodation, agricultural land, and industrial space Consequently, authorities are constantly forced to allocate more land to meet these human essentials.=>Consequently, authorities are constantly compelled to allocate more land to meet these essential human needs In other words, human expansion in terms of infrastructure and industry require significant changes in the landscape.

From my perspective, both goals are equally crucial; therefore, it is imperative to take sufficient measures to achieve both goals simultaneously. By wisely planning urban expansion, the land transformations and extensions will become less drastic, substantially lowering the risks to wildlife. One quintessence is Tokyo, the most densely populated city in the world, by judiciously organising certain areas for particular purposes and constructing apartment blocks, it has minimised the land needed for expansion and remarkably benefitted inhabitants for its organisation. ->Tokyo, the world's most densely populated city, serves as a prime example. By strategically organizing specific areas for designated purposes and constructing apartment blocks, Tokyo has minimized the land required for expansion, benefiting its residents significantly

In conclusion, while human development is necessary, it should not come at the cost of endangered species. Several measures can be taken to accomplish both goals of preserving wild animals and sustaining the growth of human life.

Topic 4: **A zoo has no useful purpose. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?**

Zoos have been a topic of heated debate, with opinions varying widely on whether they serve a purpose or not. From my perspective, I completely disagree with the view that zoos have no practical utility and this essay will provide pertinent examples to substantiate my view.

To commence with, it is apparent that zoos play a critical role in education. To elucidate, unlike textbooks or documentaries, zoos provide a realistic opportunity for individuals, especially children, to learn about the natural habitat of certain animals. With the constantly evolving education standards, zoos serve as an immersive experience for youngsters to comfortably learn about wildlife, which can bolster their understanding and appreciation of nature.

Furthermore, numerous zoos are actively involved in conservation efforts. By way of clarification, several zoos are participating in breeding programs for endangered species, helping to increase population numbers and genetic diversity. For instance, breeding programmes from zoos to sustain the population of the endangered giant pandas have been largely successful. In addition, several zoos also collaborate with global conservation organisations to protect natural habitats and support wildlife reserves. In brevity, by initiating breeding programmes and cooperating with trustworthy conservation associations, zoos are instrumental in protecting living creatures at risk of vanishing.

In conclusion, while there are some justifiable concerns about keeping animals in captivity, I believe that zoos, especially modern ones, can serve as fundamental educational tools and an area to preserve species on the brink of extinction. With responsible and ethical operation, zoos can serve a meaningful purpose in society.
