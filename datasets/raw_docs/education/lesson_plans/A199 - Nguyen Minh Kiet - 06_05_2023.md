In contemporary society, there is a significant disparity in the remuneration of directors of large organisations compared to the general workforce. While some argue that this discrepancy in pay is justified, others believe that it is inherently prejudicial. In this essay, I will discuss both viewpoints and present my personal perspective with pertinent illustrations to substantiate it.

On the one hand, proponents of substantial wage for executive board members of large enterprises believe that such compensations are reasonable due to the critical roles these characters play and the immense responsibility they have to shoulder. To commence with, directors are usually tasked with making strategic and impactful decisions that can determine the success or failure of a firm. directors are usually tasked with making strategic and impactful decisions In other words, their expertise and leadership in their own field are crucial to the survival of an enterprise. Additionally, in a highly competitive market, attractive salary is particularly essential to attract talented and experienced individuals to an organisation. an attractive salary is particularly essential for attracting talented and experienced individuals By offering lucrative incentives, these companies can secure top talents in such a fierce environment. these companies can secure top talent in such a competitive environment

On the other hand, several individuals argue that the significant gap in the salary of directors and ordinary employees is fundamentally inequitable since employees are the core workforce of a company. Initially, they claim that the daily operations and overall success heavily rely on the dedication and hard work of employees. In other words, employees are individuals who initiate the majority of tasks in a company, and an organisation would struggle to achieve their goals with the absence of their workforce. employees are the individuals who carry out the majority of tasks in a company Moreover, equitable remunerations for each individual can boost the working efficiency of white-collar workers. equitable remuneration for each individual can boost the efficiency of workers On the contrary, the discrepancy in pay may foster resentment and diminish productivity among the labouring group.

From my perspective, the substantial salary that directors receive is entirely justified. While it is true that employees are the core workforce of a company, the appearance and leadership of directors is incontrovertible. Without proper supervision and strategic planning from experienced people, it is highly unlikely for an organisation to thrive. Furthermore, although impartial salary may be a catalyst for better work performances, I believe this can hinder the overall efficiency of employees. Since workers are getting paid equally, some may exploit this fairness and work less than others, receiving the payment unfairly. Since workers are paid equally, some may exploit this fairness by working less than others, thus receiving payment unfairly In addition, there is no motivation for workforce members to excel or take on further responsibilities, impeding themselves from reaching their potentials.

In conclusion, I believe that the considerable pay for directors is certainly understandable due to the paramount role they play in an organisation. While it might be reasonable to ensure a fair competition within the workplace, equal salary can be ineffective due to the aforementioned reasons.
