Theme 1: Animals

Topic 1: **Some people think that keeping pets is good for children, while others think it is dangerous and unhealthy for them. Which viewpoint do you agree with?**

Several individuals believe that having pets is beneficial for youngsters, whereas some others think that pets pose risks to the young’s well-being. From my perspective, I concur with the former view and this essay will provide pertinent illustrations to substantiate my view.

It is incontrovertible that pets can play a crucial part in a child’s emotional development. To commence with, the companionship of a pet can teach the youth about empathy, responsibility and nurturing. To elucidate, activities involved in taking care of a pet, namely feeding and showering a pet instil a sense of responsibility among children. In addition, pets can be considered as their best friends, becoming a source of comfort in difficult times. This acquaintanceship can be especially beneficial for children struggling with constant pressure and loneliness.

Furthermore, pets can induce children to become more physically active. To elaborate, children can engage in playtime activities with their pets, including walking, running or playing fetch. For instance, dogs, which are known to be significantly energetic animals, require extensive outdoor playtime to satisfy their boundless exuberance. Accordingly, youngsters will incorporate such activities into their daily routine, fostering a healthy lifestyle at an early age.

In conclusion, while there exist some concerns about potential risks from pets, possibly the hostility and diseases these animals may carry, I believe that the merits of pet ownership from young people far overshadow these disadvantages. With proper supervision, such negative points can be neglected, while still retaining both psychiatric and physical benefits for youngsters. In brevity, the advantages of pet ownership for children are indubitably apparent, outstripping potential concerns.

Topic 2: **Animals should not be used for the benefit of human beings unless there is evidence that the animals do not suffer in any way. To what extent do you agree or disagree with the statement?**

The ethical treatment of animals has become a significant concern in contemporary society, numerous individuals believe that the use of animals for human purposes is only justified if the animals are not experiencing any suffering. From my perspective, I partially agree with the statement and this essay will provide pertinent illustrations to substantiate my view.

To commence with, it is undeniable that animals are sentient beings and can experience pain and suffering. In other words, hurting animals is similar to hurting an actual human. Therefore, it is imperative that there are certain regulations concerning the welfare of animals used for human benefits. For instance, numerous policies have been placed in farms to ensure that cattles and poultry have adequate space and access to food and water.

However, the absolute requirement that animals should not suffer in any way is almost impossible to guarantee. Even with advanced technologies and stringent regulations, some level of discomfort or stress is often unavoidable. In fact, in medical research, animal testing has played a crucial role in developing life-saving treatments for both humans and animals. One prime example is insulin, a crucial treatment for diabetes, was the product of experimenting on dogs. While they suffered pain initially, the end product ultimately saved countless animals and humans from diabetes.

In conclusion, while it is essential to entirely remove the pain from using animals for the sake of humanity, it is not entirely practical at present. Personally, I believe that we should strive to minimise the pain inflicted on other species while still using them for our own well-being. In essence, animals are still crucial in enhancing human lives, although discomforts from animals should be reduced.

Topic 3: **Some people think that human needs for farmland, housing, and industry are more important than saving land for endangered animals. Do you agree or disagree with this point of view? Why or why not?**

The debate over whether human needs for farmland, housing, and industry should take precedence over conserving land for endangered animals is a complex and contentious issue. Personally, I partially agree with the statement and this essay will provide pertinent illustrations to substantiate my view.

To commence with, it is apparent that biodiversity is essential for the health of our planet. In other words, certain endangered animals may play specific roles in their ecosystems, contributing to the balance and functionality of these environments. Hence, the disappearance of such species can have a cascading effect. For example, various species of sea turtles, which are increasingly endangered, are crucial for the maintenance of coral reefs and transporting nutrients from the ocean to coastal dunes and beaches. Their deprivation could be potentially detrimental to numerous other species.

On the other hand, the development of human life cannot be overlooked. Initially, the exponential growth of human population is indisputably immense, which is followed by the increased demand for accommodation, agricultural and industrial land. Consequently, authorities are constantly forced to allocate more land to meet these human essentials. In other words, human expansion in terms of infrastructure and industry require significant changes in the landscape.

From my perspective, both goals are equally crucial; therefore, it is imperative to take sufficient measures to achieve both goals simultaneously. By wisely planning urban expansion, the land transformations and extensions will become less drastic, substantially lowering the risks to wildlife. One quintessence is Tokyo, the most densely populated city in the world, by judiciously organising certain areas for particular purposes and constructing apartment blocks, it has minimised the land needed for expansion and remarkably benefitted inhabitants for its organisation.

In conclusion, while human development is necessary, it should not come at the cost of endangered species. Several measures can be taken to accomplish both goals of preserving wild animals and sustaining the growth of human life.

Topic 4: **A zoo has no useful purpose. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?**

Zoos have been a topic of heated debate, with opinions varying widely on whether they serve a purpose or not. From my perspective, I completely disagree with the view that zoos have no practical utility and this essay will provide pertinent examples to substantiate my view.

To commence with, it is apparent that zoos play a critical role in education. To elucidate, unlike textbooks or documentaries, zoos provide a realistic opportunity for individuals, especially children, to learn about the natural habitat of certain animals. With the constantly evolving education standards, zoos serve as an immersive experience for youngsters to comfortably learn about wildlife, which can bolster their understanding and appreciation of nature.

Furthermore, numerous zoos are actively involved in conservation efforts. By way of clarification, several zoos are participating in breeding programs for endangered species, helping to increase population numbers and genetic diversity. For instance, breeding programmes from zoos to sustain the population of the endangered giant pandas have been largely successful. In addition, several zoos also collaborate with global conservation organisations to protect natural habitats and support wildlife reserves. In brevity, by initiating breeding programmes and cooperating with trustworthy conservation associations, zoos are instrumental in protecting living creatures at risk of vanishing.

In conclusion, while there are some justifiable concerns about keeping animals in captivity, I believe that zoos, especially modern ones, can serve as fundamental educational tools and an area to preserve species on the brink of extinction. With responsible and ethical operation, zoos can serve a meaningful purpose in society.

Theme 2: Music and arts

**Topic 1: Art and music are considered some of the fundamental elements of all societies. Do you think art and music still have a place in today’s modern world of technology? Should children spend more time learning art and music at school?**

The discussion surrounding the relevance of art and music in contemporary society amidst the pervasive influence of the modern world is a topic of heated debate. Personally, I believe that art and music remain vital in contemporary society, and this essay will provide pertinent illustrations to substantiate my view.

To commence with, art and music are integral to the human experience, serving as mediums for expression, cultural preservation, and emotional connection. In other words, these creative forms allow individuals to express complex emotions and ideas that transcend linguistic barriers. For example, Beethoven's symphonies continue to evoke deep emotional responses and are celebrated across cultures, demonstrating music's timeless impact.

Furthermore, the advancement of technology has transformed how we create, share, and experience art and music. To elucidate, digital platforms and tools have democratised access to these creative forms, enabling more people to participate in and appreciate them. For instance, platforms like YouTube and Spotify allow artists and musicians to reach a global audience, fostering a more inclusive cultural landscape. Moreover, technology has introduced new forms of art, such as digital painting and electronic music, expanding the boundaries of creative expression and cementing the role of art in contemporary society.

From my perspective, incorporating art and music into children's education is crucial in today's technological age. By engaging in artistic activities, children develop a sense of curiosity and innovation, which are essential for problem-solving and adapting to new challenges. One example is Finland, where the education system places a strong emphasis on art and music, resulting in well-rounded students who excel in various fields.

In conclusion, art and music undeniably retain their significance in modern society, enriched and expanded by technological advancements. Ensuring that children spend more time learning these subjects at school is imperative, as it nurtures essential skills and fosters a deeper appreciation for cultural heritage and personal expression.

Topic 2: **Some think that quality art can be made by anyone while others think that it requires special talent and ability. Discuss both views and give your opinion.**

There is a divergence of opinions regarding the creation of exceptional artworks, with some believing that it can be produced by anyone, while others argue that it necessitates innate talent and skill. In this essay, I will analyse both sides of the argument and present my own perspective with pertinent illustrations to support it.

On the one hand, there is a compelling argument that meticulous art requires outstanding competence and capability. To commence with, some individuals possess innate abilities that allow them to perceive and create art in ways that others cannot. For instance, the renowned painter Pablo Picasso demonstrated extraordinary artistic talent as a child, which was honed through years of dedicated practice.

On the other hand, it is equally valid to argue that anyone can create quality art with the right mindset and effort. Initially, art is a form of expression that is accessible to everyone, regardless of their background or innate abilities. For example, Vincent van Gogh, who is celebrated as one of the greatest painters in history, did not show any particular artistic prowess during his early years and only began painting in his late twenties. Additionally, the majority of his iconic works were created in the last few years of his life, demonstrating how late it was for him to achieve success.

From my perspective, both views hold merit; however, I believe that while innate talent can provide an advantage, the creation of quality art is primarily driven by unwavering passion and constant determination. Accordingly, by nurturing their creativity and continuously honing their skills, individuals can overcome initial limitations and achieve artistic excellence.

In conclusion, while special talent and ability can contribute to the creation of quality art, it is not an absolute requirement. I believe that with dedication and effort, anyone can develop the skills necessary to produce stunning masterpieces.

Theme 3: Languages

Topic 1: **Some people say that music is a good way of bringing people of different cultures and ages together. To what extent do you agree or disagree with this opinion?**

The notion that music serves as a unifying force, bringing individuals from diverse cultures and generations together is a contentious topic. Personally, I completely agree with this statement, and this essay will provide pertinent examples to substantiate my view.

To commence with, music is a universal language that transcends cultural and generational boundaries. For instance, global events such as the Olympic Games or the FIFA World Cup often feature performances by artists whose music resonates across the globe. These performances are enjoyed by people from diverse backgrounds, creating a shared experience that fosters unity. Additionally, musical genres like classical, jazz, and blues have been embraced worldwide, regardless of their origins, illustrating music’s ability to bridge cultural gaps. To elucidate, jazz and blues were originally popularised by artists of African origins, while classical was widely enjoyed by people of European descents. However, now, such genres are heard worldwide, illustrating music’s influence.

Moreover, it is undeniable music has a unique capacity to connect different generations. With the constant impact of social media in contemporary society, classic masterpieces from previous decades often experience revivals, allowing younger generations to appreciate the music their parents or grandparents enjoyed. For instance, old artists, namely The Beatles or Led Zeppelin still accumulate millions of listeners on Spotify, showcasing their timeless relevance to people of all ages.

In conclusion, music undeniably serves as a powerful medium for bringing people together across cultural and generational divides. By providing shared experiences and common interests, music fosters a sense of unity and understanding among diverse backgrounds and age groups.

Topic 2: **Some people feel that entertainers (e.g., film stars, pop musicians or sports stars) are paid too much money. Do you agree or disagree? Which other types of job should be highly paid?**

The question of whether entertainers such as film stars, pop musicians, or sports stars are paid too much money is a contentious issue. Personally, I partially agree with this view and this essay will provide pertinent illustrations to substantiate my stance.

To commence with, it is undeniable that entertainers often receive exorbitant salaries. For instance, top athletes and Hollywood actors can earn millions of dollars annually, which seems disproportionate compared to the average worker’s income. This discrepancy can be attributed to the high revenues they generate for their industries through ticket sales, merchandise, and endorsements. Nevertheless, while their talents and hard work deserve recognition, the vast sums they earn highlight significant income inequality.

On the other hand, certain professions that are crucial to society’s well-being are often underpaid. For example, teachers play a fundamental role in shaping future generations, yet their compensation frequently does not reflect the importance of their work. Similarly, healthcare workers, including nurses and paramedics, who save lives and provide essential care to patients, often receive modest salaries despite their critical responsibilities.

From my perspective, a more balanced approach to remuneration is necessary. Jobs that contribute significantly to society's foundation and functioning should be highly paid. For instance, educators, healthcare professionals, and emergency responders deserve better financial recognition for their invaluable contributions. By increasing the pay for these roles, society would not only acknowledge their importance but also encourage more individuals to pursue these vital careers.

In conclusion, while the earnings of entertainers can seem excessive, it is essential to reassess the value placed on various professions. By ensuring that crucial jobs such as teaching and healthcare are well-compensated, we can create a more equitable and appreciative society.
