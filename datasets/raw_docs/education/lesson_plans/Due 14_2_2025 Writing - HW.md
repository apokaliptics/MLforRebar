**Task 1:***(image removed)*

The given table illustrates the average yearly salary in several sectors in 2004, and the proportions of the change compared to 2003, meanwhile, the pie chart details the distribution of the graduated students in these sectors.

As can be seen from two graphs, public services offered the highest average salary, while agriculture paid the least. Besides that, wholesale and retail trade experienced the greatest salary increase. Regarding employment rates, most graduates worked in public services and agriculture, whereas finance employed the fewest.

In terms of salary, public services had the highest average annual income at 92,000, with a 3.7% increase from the previous year. Finance followed closely at 83.000 with its 2.9% growth. The wholesale and retail sector, despite having a relatively lower salary of 77.000, experienced the most significant salary rise of 8.4%. On the other hand, agriculture offered the lowest salary at 40.000, with a modest increase of 2.31%. Meanwhile, salaries in manufacturing and transportation were 52.000 and 81.000, with increments of 4% and 4.5%, in turn. The remaining sector, wholesale and retail trade, recorded a salary of 77.000 with the highest increase of 8.4%, despite being lower than finance and public services.

Regarding employment distribution, 30% of graduates worked in public services, making it the most popular sector. Agriculture ranked second, attracting 25% of graduates in spite of offering the lowest pay. Manufacturing accounted for 20%, while transportation, and wholesale and retail each employed 10% of the graduates. Interestingly, only 5% chose to work in the finance sector, even though it provided one of the highest salaries.

**Task 2:** Students at school and the university learn far more from lessons with the teachers than from other sources (such as Internet and television). To what extent do you agree or disagree?

Education is a cornerstone of personal and professional growth, and the debate over the most effective learning methods continues. While some argue that students benefit more from modern resources such as the Internet and television, others believe that teachers remain irreplaceable. In this essay, I will address both viewpoints and discuss my own opinion.

On one hand, teachers are fundamental to students’ academic and personal growth. Indeed, classroom learning promotes discipline, collaboration, and communication. Moreover, structured lessons and group discussions help students develop teamwork skills that self-directed learning through digital platforms often lacks. Besides that, teachers also foster important life skills such as critical thinking, collaboration, and problem-solving. To elucidate, beyond academics, they serve as mentors, offering guidance, encouragement, and emotional support that helps students build confidence and resilience through classroom discussions, group activities, and even deep conversations between them and their students.

On the other hand, extra resources provide access to a wide range of information. Take platforms like YouTube and educational websites as the prime quintessence, they offer a vast range of information on various topics, enabling students to explore beyond their curriculum. Additionally, these resources are entirely available anytime, which supports self-paced learning, immediately answers and allows students to revisit materials as needed, making learning more efficient and personalized.

While online resources and television are valuable supplements, teachers remain the most important source of learning. The ideal approach combines the structured, personalized teaching provided by educators with the diverse, flexible resources offered by digital platforms.

In conclusion, both teachers and extra resources play important roles in the academic enlargement and skill-building experiences. Accordingly, we should combine the teachers' mentorship and adaptability, with interpersonal engagement to make them irreplaceable in the learning process.
