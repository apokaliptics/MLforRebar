In the current period of austerity, employers are becoming more and more attracted to the creativity of internships, as a cheap way of extending their workforce – and young people are usually more than willing to work unpaid or for minimal wages, in order to gain valuable experience and get them closer to the first rung on the career path. Unpaid interns are in a vulnerable position, often afraid to take action against their employers for fear that they might be led the door. Therefore, a jounalism intern has scored a victory for interns everywhere by successfully suing her publishing company employer, for whom she interned unpaid for several weeks. Keri Hudson, 21, proved in an employment tribunal that she had the right to be paid for two months’ work she carried on last year, despite having no written contract with her employer
