Technology

1. **VR/AR PLATFORM** (A VR/AR platform refers to a system or framework that enables the creation, deployment, and use of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) applications)

* **Definition:**
* VR (Virtual Reality): Virtual Reality (VR) is a technology that uses computer-generated simulations to create immersive, interactive, and three-dimensional environments.
* AR (Augmented Reality): Augmented Reality (AR) is a technology that overlays digital content, such as images, sounds, or other virtual elements, onto the real-world environment in real time.
* Difference:
* These platforms often include hardware (like headsets and controllers), software development tools, and content libraries.
* **Applications and Problems**
* Applications:
* Education: Provide stimulation for training, teaching, especially in science subjects such as Physics or Biology.
* Entertainment: Provide new way of experience recreational activities such as watching movies or playing games
* Workplace Collaboration: Virtual meeting spaces and training sessions.
* Problems:
* Blurred Reality Boundaries: The immersive nature of VR/AR can distort users’ perception of reality.
* Data Privacy Risks: Personal and behavioral data are vulnerable to exploitation.
* Social Isolation: Excessive use can lead to disconnection from the physical world.
* **Example**
* 1943 Berlin Blitz in 360° (By BBC): Help students understand what it was like to live through a significant historical event.
* Microsoft HoloLens (By Microsoft): Help medical students and clinicians to learn about the human body using mixed reality
* Apple Vision Pro (Apple): Help users to be immerse in the virtual world
* **Essay question:** VR and AR technology is gradually increasing its appearance in every aspect of human livings. What are the reasons for this phenomenon? And is this a negative or positive development?

1. **CRYPTOCURRENCIES**

* **Definition:**
* Cryptocurrencies are decentralized digital currencies that use cryptographic techniques for secure transactions and operate on blockchain technology.
* Blockchain technology: Blockchain is a digital ledger that securely records and stores data across a network of computers in a way that makes it nearly impossible to change or hack
* **Applications and problems:**
* Applications:
* Decentralized Finance (DeFi): Provides financial services like lending and borrowing without traditional banks.
* Digital Payments: Facilitates fast and borderless transactions with lower fees compared to traditional systems.
* **Problems:**
* Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile, making them risky for investment and transactions.
* Regulatory Uncertainty: Governments worldwide have differing and evolving stances on cryptocurrencies.
* Energy Consumption: Mining certain cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, requires significant energy, raising environmental concerns.
* **Example**
* **Bitcoin (BTC)**: The first and most widely recognized cryptocurrency.
* **Essay question:** Cryptocurrencies are often seen as a revolutionary financial innovation. Some people say that it will likely replace traditional transactions in the near future. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

1. **GENETIC MODIFICATION - CLONES**

* **Definition:**
* Genetic modification involves altering the DNA of an organism to change its traits or functions, often using advanced biotechnological tools like CRISPR.
* Cloning is the process of creating a genetically identical copy of an organism, cell, or DNA sequence, either naturally (as in identical twins) or artificially through techniques like somatic cell nuclear transfer.
* **Applications and problems**
* **Applications:**
* Medicine: Genetic modification is used to develop gene therapies to treat diseases like cancer and genetic disorders. Cloning can produce genetically identical animals for organ transplantation and drug testing.
* Agriculture: Genetically modified (GM) crops are designed to resist pests, tolerate drought, and improve yields.
* Conservation: Genetic modification can create disease-resistant species.
* Food Production: GM organisms ensure higher quality and production efficiency.
* **Problems:**
* Ethical concerns: Cloning raises questions about the moral implications of creating life artificially.
* Genetic modification can lead to unintended consequences that distort the standard of the norm
* **Example**
* CRISPR: Used to develop disease-resistant crops like Golden Rice.
* Dolly the sheep
* **Essay question:** There are people who see genetic modification and cloning as revolutionary technologies that offer significant benefits but some argue that they pose ethical and societal challenges. Discuss both views and give your own opinion?

1. **PRIVACY AND CYBER SECURITY**

* **Definition**
* **Applications and problems**
* **Applications:**
* **Problems:**
* Privacy Invasion: Social media, surveillance, and data mining practices raise concerns about personal privacy being compromised.
* Hacking and Cybercrime: The rise in cyberattacks, including ransomware, phishing, and identity theft, poses a significant threat to individuals and organizations.
* Lack of Awareness: Many people are unaware of proper cybersecurity practices, leading to vulnerable online behavior.
* **Example**
* End-to-End Encryption
* China’s data policy
* **Essay question:** With the growing reliance on digital technologies, the issues of cyber privacy have become more critical. Some people say that the government should prioritize the control of social media over users’ privacy. To what extent do you agree or disagree?

1. **ONLINE MEDIA - FAKE NEWS AND PROPAGANDA**

* **Definition:**
* Fake news refers to false or misleading information presented as news, often spread through social media or websites with the intention to deceive or influence public opinion.
* Propaganda is biased or misleading information used to promote a particular political cause, ideology, or viewpoint, often through media platforms, to manipulate or control public perception.
* **Applications and problems**
* **Applications:**
* **Problems:**
* Undermining Trust: Fake news erodes trust in traditional media, experts, and institutions, making it harder for people to differentiate between truth and fiction.
* Misinformation Spread: Fake news spreads quickly, often leading to confusion, mistrust, and false beliefs among the public.
* **Example**
* COVID-19 Misinformation: During the pandemic, false claims about virus cures, vaccine dangers, and government conspiracies spread widely online, causing confusion and resistance to public health measures.
* Deepfake technology: uses AI to create hyper-realistic videos, audio, or images that manipulate or replace the likeness and voice of individuals.
* **Essay question:** Fake news and propaganda through online media are now on the rise. While some people say that the government should carry the responsibility for these problems, others believe individuals might be in charge of it. Discuss both views and give your own opinion?

Cybercrime

• Solve the education gaps

• Saudi arabia now seek to integrate with the world economies on a more socially and culturally opened manner, move away from an oil-dominant countries. (Diversification: technology, education, tourisms, local economies)

4. Millions of dollars are spent on space reseach every year. Some people argue that the money should be spent on living standards on earth (agree or disagree)

Improve social safety nets (Unions, representatives)

Reduce digital divide --- On-site training and promotions

Equals should be treated equally (equality) : Subsidies -- Elated demands --- Jobs etccccc

To each his due (equity): Surplus of wealth --- Capital investments --- Jobs, lower interests rate

---- Universial wage income ----------- Policies that seek to reduce radical instability

5. Employements are on the rise today? What are the causes of this ?

Navigating the job market

Job creation vs job displacement (industrializatin) + reduced demands (external factors)

Highskilled workers vs overqualified vocations (mac job, pink collar).

Universial wage incomes

+ Lack of motivation for work, a lifestyle deprived of meanings - Ethics decadence, hedonistic lifestyles

+ Taxes ---------- Discourage much-need investments and foreign money.
