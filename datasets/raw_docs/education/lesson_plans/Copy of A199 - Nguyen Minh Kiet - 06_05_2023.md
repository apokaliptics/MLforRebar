Task 1:

The line chart illustrates the figure for foreign visitors to the UK for three particular purposes from 1989 to 2009.

Overall, there was a rise in the number of international travellers visiting the UK, with going on a holiday being the most common reason throughout the time frame. Conversely, visiting friends or relatives saw the lowest numbers.

Upon closer inspection, after three decades, holidaymakers consistently remained the leading cause for visiting the UK, exceeding 6 million in 1989 and peaking at nearly 10 million a decade later. Despite suffering a slight dip to approximately 8 million in 2004, this figure later rebounded to roughly 9 million by the end of the period.

From 1989 to 1994, the number of overseas business people travelling to the UK dropped from 5.5 million to 4 million. However, this category saw a sharp increase, reaching its peak of 8 million in 2007, coupled with a slight decline following the end of the time frame. Meanwhile, visitors of the UK for family reasons started at just below 4 million in 1989. Subsequently, there was a gradual climb to a high of about 7 million people in 2004, before falling down to just above 6 million in 2007.

Task 2:

In contemporary society, there is a significant disparity in the remuneration of directors of large organisations compared to the general workforce. While some argue that this discrepancy in pay is justified, others believe that it is inherently prejudicial. In this essay, I will discuss both viewpoints and present my personal perspective with pertinent illustrations to substantiate it.

On the one hand, proponents of substantial wage for executive board members of large enterprises believe that such compensations are reasonable due to the critical roles these characters play and the immense responsibility they have to shoulder. To commence with, directors are usually tasked with making strategic and impactful decisions that can determine the success or failure of a firm. In other words, their expertise and leadership in their own field are crucial to the survival of an enterprise. Additionally, in a highly competitive market, attractive salary is particularly essential to attract talented and experienced individuals to an organisation. By offering lucrative incentives, these companies can secure top talents in such a fierce environment.

On the other hand, several individuals argue that the significant gap in the salary of directors and ordinary employees is fundamentally inequitable since employees are the core workforce of a company. Initially, they claim that the daily operations and overall success heavily rely on the dedication and hard work of employees. In other words, employees are individuals who initiate the majority of tasks in a company, and an organisation would struggle to achieve their goals with the absence of their workforce. Moreover, equitable remunerations for each individual can boost the working efficiency of white-collar workers. On the contrary, the discrepancy in pay may foster resentment and diminish productivity among the labouring group.

From my perspective, the substantial salary that directors receive is entirely justified. While it is true that employees are the core workforce of a company, the appearance and leadership of directors is incontrovertible. Without proper supervision and strategic planning from experienced people, it is highly unlikely for an organisation to thrive. Furthermore, although impartial salary may be a catalyst for better work performances, I believe this can hinder the overall efficiency of employees. Since workers are getting paid equally, some may exploit this fairness and work less than others, receiving the payment unfairly. In addition, there is no motivation for workforce members to excel or take on further responsibilities, impeding themselves from reaching their potentials.

In conclusion, I believe that the considerable pay for directors is certainly understandable due to the paramount role they play in an organisation. While it might be reasonable to ensure a fair competition within the workplace, equal salary can be ineffective due to the aforementioned reasons.
