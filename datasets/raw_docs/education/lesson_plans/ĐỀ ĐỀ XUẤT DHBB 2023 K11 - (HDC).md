To your 160.5 lovely so step forward

Amy and Nancy are 24-year-old twins

So Amy and Nancy what we want to do is to look at how food processing impacts your health

They’re taking part in a test with Dr Sarah Berry and Professor Tim Spector from King’s College London what you’re going to do is for two weeks

Nancy you’re going to be doing the unprocessed diet and Amy you’re going to be eating the ultra-processed diet then we’re going to get you back here and then we’re going to do the same test again and look at how these different foods have impacted your health

The twins diet will be matched exactly for calories nutrients fat sugar and fiber.

Food accounts for more than 50 of our energy intake and it’s an even bigger problem in children so it counts about 65 of our energy intake for children. This is actually increasing at an alarming rate. We believe ultra processed foods are having an unfavorable effect on our health is because the ultra processing Foods breaks down the structure of the foods often. Ultra processed foods have very little fiber in them or the fiber is removed many of these ingredients most people won’t have heard of but what we don’t know is how all of these different chemicals might interact together in terms of our health .

I do eat some processed foods just out of convenience but I do love lots of fresher and have quite healthy diet I think so I think it is going to be a bit of a shift .

For breakfast this morning I had a quinoa porridge with berries on top and done a really good job of keep me energized and full so it’s the end of the day now and i’ve got a bit of a headache to be honest.

So yeah ending the day still hungry feeling a bit sort of rubbish and yeah a bit of a headache.

Lots of the things that you’ve just described about your headache all point to the fact that you’re probably having what we call a glucose drip which is a drip in blood sugar that happens about two to four hours after people consume really heavily processed refined carbohydrates .

This is a mousse made with fruit puree and only 73 calories yeah you’d think that would be a healthy option.

Oh my goodness pork gelatin glucose fructose syrup acidity regulator citric acid sodium hydroxide modified May starch .

There’s a term we use called the health Halo where you you know you have packaging says uh high in fiber or low in sugar low in salt plant-based all of these kind of magic words that make people think wow these are really healthy if anything ever says low reduced or no I’d always be a bit suspicious because how else have they therefore made that food taste great

in the last decade the evidence has been slowly growing that Ultra processed food is harmful for us in ways we hadn’t thought

Could ‘intelligent’ forklifts be the future of industry?

The Humble forklift has been the backbone of global industry for over a hundred years and now they’re getting a 21st century makeover here at Fox robotics in Austin they’ve created what they call the world’s first intelligent forklift. Beyond being just self-driving it can unload and receive packages completely autonomously so we start with a standard counterbalance stand-up forklift. we add sensors for both perception being able to understand the world around the forklift as well as safety, so our primary sensors are we have one camera right here between the forks oh yeah uh it is both a depth camera as well as in regular camera that helps the pallet detector so that it can determine is that a pallet what type of palette is it what direction is it are other main sensors is we have three micro scan lidar so there’s two forward and there’s one if we walk all the way around there’s one back here that’s steer ward oh okay yeah I see it yep so that pretty much gives a 360 degree view uh on a on a plane about that far off the floor um so this is a safety-rated programmable logic controller and it has safety rated input outputs so that’s making its decisions and working out where to go and what to do yep the robot can unload 25 pallets in an hour but there are limitations it’s really easy to build a robot that works once building robot that works every single time day in day out that’s a that’s something that matters a lot to us figuring out how to both meet the the workflow needs that our customers have and you know maintain our perfect safety record and be compliant with all the required standards is a a real challenge for introducing any kind of new autonomous system into a workplace thank you [Music] and when they work is slightly unnerving at first it’s quite strange how quickly you get used to the fact that this is just driving around by itself I’m already completely happy with the fact that there’s a very large very heavy piece of equipment driving around autonomously [Music] but what about the impact on jobs everyone complaint that all of our customers have is that finding labor for warehouses is just so hard these these days they need to hire more and more people and most of these warehouses are outside of major population centers so by augmenting the people that work in these warehouses with autonomous forklifts you can you know get more done with less than it to stay competitive and you know get the job done as the world changes and automation becomes more common. it’s clear that Innovation and Industry face some conflicting times ahead but in the Brave New World your next parcel delivery might have been on part of its Journey thanks to one of these
