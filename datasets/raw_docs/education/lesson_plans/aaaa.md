1. **Read the following extract and use your own words to summarize it. Your summary should be between 100 and 120 words.**

The extract elucidates how the media portrays the standard of beauty, the driving factors of body image awareness and what it reflects. It is revealed that there is a contrast between the image shown in the media and the typical American body, coupled with a routinely delivered message that we do not suffice. The leading forces for personal body perception are relatives, friends and others, especially parents who are instrumental in body image development. Additionally, communications between close individuals are influential in physical self-perception. Physical appearance is also a standard to illustrate cultural perceptions, with different societies holding varying beauty standards.

3. **Discipline is an ever-increasing problem in many schools in Vietnam. Some people think that discipline should be the responsibility of teachers, while others think that this is the role of parents. Discuss both views and give your opinion.**

In current Vietnamese educational institutions, discipline has been a pressing concern. Several individuals argue that teachers should be responsible for the enforcement of discipline, whereas others contend that it should be the obligation of parents. In this essay, I will discuss both viewpoints and present pertinent illustrations to substantiate my perspective.

On the one hand, it is apparent that teachers possess professional expertise that can be instrumental in maintaining discipline. To commence with, teachers are highly trained professionals equipped with pedagogical knowledge and child psychology. Accordingly, they are capable of identifying underlying causes of misbehaviour and implementing effective solutions. Moreover, by utilising their competence in such fields, they can create a structured and supportive learning environment that fosters positive behaviour. For instance, gamification techniques can make lessons interactive and engaging, promoting self-discipline among students.

On the other hand, proponents of parental responsibility emphasise the formative influence of the home environment on a child's behaviour. Initially, parents are the primary caregivers and role models, shaping their children's character and values from a young age. Indeed, parents provide their offspring with life essentials and unwavering affection. Furthermore, their consistent presence throughout a child's life affords them immense influence. Undeniably, mother and father are the sole forces that would accompany their children along their development, from infancy to maturity. Hence, they have the power to instil essential values and life skills during their growth.

From my perspective, it is imperative to recognise the equitable importance that both educators and parents play in shaping a child's character and behaviour. While teachers provide academic instruction and create a conducive learning environment, parents remain the forces crucial in supporting their children in the long-term, both academically and emotionally. Therefore, a harmonious partnership between these two key stakeholders is essential for fostering a holistic development of students.

In conclusion, fostering discipline in students necessitates a collaborative effort between teachers and parents. Undoubtedly, both parties play crucial roles in a child's development, and their combined strengths can create a nurturing environment where students can thrive in multiple aspects of their lives.
