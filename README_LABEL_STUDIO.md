# Label Studio — Paragraph Split Labeling

Steps to label paragraph split candidates:

1. Install Label Studio: `pip install label-studio` (or follow official docs).
2. Start Label Studio: `label-studio start` and create a new project.
3. In the project, go to Settings -> Labeling Interface and paste the contents of `labeling_config.xml`.
4. Import tasks: Project -> Import -> choose `labelstudio_tasks.jsonl` from the workspace root.
   - This file was generated by `scripts/generate_labelstudio_tasks.py` or by the notebook cell.
5. Label tasks using the UI. Choose `split` if the boundary should be a paragraph break, otherwise `no_split`.
6. Export the completed annotations (JSON) and save it as `labelstudio_export.json` in the workspace root.
7. In the notebook `notebooks/paragraph_split.ipynb`, run the conversion cell to create `training_data.csv` and then run the train cell to fit and export `paragraph_split_model.json`.

Tips:
- Start with around 50–200 labeled examples to get a sensible model.
- If you have many tasks, use the project settings to assign a small batch to yourself first.
- Use the exported `paragraph_split_model.json` in Rebar as described in the notebook.
